Many thanks to everyone who came out for [the first #geomob of 2017](http://geomobldn.org/post/154396358235/first-geomob-of-2017-25th-jan-at-new-venue) last week.

It was a strong turnout and good talks. A special thanks goes out to our new hosts [Traveltech Lab](http://thetrampery.com/workspaces/traveltech-lab/) for their amazing venue. Anyone doing a start-up in the travel space in London should check them out. I’m hopeful we’ll be back there later in the year. Many thanks to all the speakers and a special congrats to SplashMaps best speaker prize winner [Mike Thompson](https://twitter.com/mikejthompson) for his talk about  
[AdmissionsDay](http://admissionsday.co.uk/).

Looking forward, our next event at 18:30 on the evening of Wednesday the 29th of March we’ll be with our friends at [Geovation](https://geovation.uk/hub/) in Clerkenwell (1 Sekforde Street, EC1R 0BE, or [pushed.kinks.battle](http://w3w.co/pushed.kinks.battle)) We’ve been fortunate to host #geomob there before, it is an excellent location. Many thanks to them for having us back.

No change to our tried and true format - each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to present their project, they’ll then face a few minutes of questions from the audience, and at the end we’ll select a best speaker before heading to a nearby pub for discussion over goobers generously made possible by our sponsors [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), and [KnowWhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/). If your company is interested in sponsoring [please get in touch](http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship).   

I’m happy to report we once again have an excellent line-up of volunteer speakers.

If you can join us, please [sign-up on the Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-march/) so we have a sense of numbers. Unfortunately, the service has been fairly unreliable lately. If it’s down please just try again later or just show up. All suggestions for a better alternative are gladly received. 

If you can’t join us in March (or even if you can), our next event will be Wednesday the 14th of  June. Our friends at UCL [have once again agreed to host us](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-june/). Thanks!

see you on March 29th,
