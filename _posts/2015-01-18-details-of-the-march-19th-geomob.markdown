After a [strong start to 2015](http://geomobldn.org/post/108249155865/2015-starts-off-well), we’ll be doing the best to keep the momentum going at our next event, which will take place at 18:30 on Thursday, the 19th of March. We’ll be back at the 3rd floor of [Campus near Old Street](https://www.campuslondon.com/), many thanks to the good folks there for once again hosting us. As always we ask you to sign up [on the lanyrd page for the event](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-march/) (where you can also find a map to the venue) so we can get a sense of the numbers.

We also ask that you arrive on time, as we’ll be starting promptly as we again have a full roster of six interesting speakers. The evening will feature

*   [Mike Hall](https://twitter.com/thisismikehall) will share [his maps of London](http://www.thisismikehall.com/)
*   [James Milner](https://twitter.com/JamesLMilner) will present about [Lacuna](https://github.com/LoxodromeGit/Lacuna), a 3D web GIS  

*   [Mark Lester](https://twitter.com/wikitimetable) will talk about [wikitimetable](http://wikitimetable.com/), his attempt to crowdsource a journey planner for south east Asia
*   [Nina Tumanishvili](https://twitter.com/ninachinoo) will discuss her still under development location based start up
*   [Gavin Love](https://twitter.com/GavinLove) will talk about geo at [MyBuilder](http://www.mybuilder.com/)

and our final speaker of the evening will be

*   [Felix Lamouroux](https://twitter.com/FelixLamouroux), the founder of the agency behind [Offmaps](http://offmaps.com/) and [Trails](https://trails.io/en/)

As always each speaker will have a maximum of 15 minutes and then a few minutes for audience questions. Afterwards we will retire to a nearby pub where the first few rounds of #geobeers will be paid for by our generous sponsors (please thanks them!)

We have also [opened the lanyrd page for the following #geomob](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-may/) which will take place on the 19th of May. The speaker list is already full, please sign up if you can join us.

If you don’t yet, please [follow @geomob on twitter](https://twitter.com/geomob), where we will post any relevant announcements. Beyond that we do our best to keep the account low volume.

We look forward to seeing one and all on the 19th of March. Many thanks to all of our speakers for volunteering, the hosts for providing the venue, and the sponsors for making it all possible.

yours in geo-innovation
