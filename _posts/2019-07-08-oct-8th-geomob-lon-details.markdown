<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been:

* doors open at 18:00, set up and general mingling

* at 18:30 we begin the talks with a very brief introduction

* Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.
After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.

* We vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

* We head to a nearby pub for discussion and #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors.
