Our next #geomob will see us returning to [the BCS](http://www.bcs.org/) near Covent Garden (5 Southampton Street) at 18:30 on Wednesday the 7th of September. Many thanks to them for once again generously hosting us at their excellent facilities. [Please sign up on the lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-september/) so we can estimate numbers, you’ll also find a map to the venue on that page. 

As ever, our format for the evening will be a mix of speakers from a broad spectrum of the geo world. Each will present for 10-15 minutes on their topic, then field a few minutes of questions. At the end we’ll quickly vote for the best speaker and award him or her with a [SplashMap](http://www.splash-maps.com/) and then adjourn to a neary pub to continue the discussions. 

Our line-up for the evening is:

1.  Chris Blanchard of [postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io/)  

2.  [Alexander Brett](http://alexander-brett.co.uk/) presenting his work on visualising London  

3.  [Christian Rouffaert](https://twitter.com/Roufmeister) will tell us about his start-up [Teragence](http://www.teragence.com/)
4.  [Claire Fram](https://twitter.com/claire_fram) and Yannis Fourniadis will share their experience organizing mapathons at Arup
5.  [Julius Osokinas](https://twitter.com/josokinas) will tell us about Mapping for Change’s [Community Maps](https://communitymaps.org.uk)  

We still have room for one more speaker if you would like to present. We welcome talks from anyone doing anything interesting related to geo, be it as a hobby project, academic work, a start-up, a non-profit, or a global business.

Many thanks to all of our speakers and of course also to our sponsors who pay for the post talks beers.
