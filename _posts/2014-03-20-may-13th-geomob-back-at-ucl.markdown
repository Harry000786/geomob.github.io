Nice work everyone, this week’s #geomob at Campus was our biggest yet, this shot captures only about half the audience.

My thanks to all six of our speakers. [Benjamin Hennig](https://twitter.com/geoviews) has posted an [overview of his talk](http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=3978). As the other speakers make their slides public we will tweet the URLs from [the geomob account](https://twitter.com/geomob) (which you all no doubt follow).

The quality of the talks over the course of the evening was a testament to the wide variety of geo-innovation happening in and around London. Against tough competition [Jason Davies](https://twitter.com/jasondavies) was able to win the crowd over with his talk about D3 and thus became the first winner of the coveted best speaker prize: [a custom SplashMap](http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/). Well done Jason! We look forward to carrying on the best speaker SplashMap tradition at all future #geomobs. Here’s a picture of SplashMaps CEO (and former two-time #geomob speaker!) [David Overton](https://twitter.com/dbyhundred) congratulating Jason on his victory.

I am pleased that we’re already able to announce a great lineup for our next event. On Tuesday the 13th of May at 18:30 we’ll return to Pearson Lecture Theatre at UCL.  Exact details, including a map, can be found on [the Lanyrd page for the evening](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-may/), where we ask you to sign up so we can estimate the audience size. 

The agenda for the evening will feature 10-15 minute talks from:

*   [Andrew Brown](https://twitter.com/BurtEDitch) of [Toursome](http://tourso.me/)
*   Manuel Timita of [illustreets](http://illustreets.co.uk/)
*   [Jimmy Tidey](https://twitter.com/Jimmytidey) of [Heresay](http://heresay.org.uk/)
*   [Oliver Roick](http://oliverroick.de/) of [UCL’s Citizen Extreme Science Research Group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/excites/) 
*   [Chris Sheldrick](https://twitter.com/ChrisSheldrick2) of [what3words](http://what3words.com/)
*   [James Siddle](https://twitter.com/jamessiddle) will speak about his visualisation of Boris Bike network use 

After the talks we will vote for the evening’s best speaker and then adjourn to a nearby pub to carry on the conversation. It’s all made possible by the generosity of our hosts, the [UCL Dept of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering](http://www.cege.ucl.ac.uk), and our sponsors [knowwhere consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), [OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splashmaps.net/). Thank you!

For those of you who like to plan ahead the next #geomob after the 13th of May will take place on Thursday the 17th of July, [the signup page is already available](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-july/). A few speakers are already committed, please let us know if you’d like to volunteer. 

We look forward to seeing you all on the 13th of May

yours in geo-innovation,
