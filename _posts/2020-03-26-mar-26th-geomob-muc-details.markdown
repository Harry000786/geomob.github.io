The first #geomobMUC of 2020 will take place on March 26th!
We are still confirming the exact venue details and will post them shortly. 


**Our Speakers:**

  * [Ed Freyfogle](https://twitter.com/freyfogle) of geocoding service [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/)

  * [JP Mens](https://twitter.com/jpmens) will tell us about open-source,
  privacy-focused, self-hosted, location tracking service [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/)
  
  * Multi-risk analysis and information system components for the Andes Region.
  Michael Langbein from DLR will give an overview of the work being done by the [RIESGOS](https://www.riesgos.de/en/)(Multi-risk
  analysis and information system components for the Andes region) project.Natural hazards often consist of multiple, cascading
  processes (an earthquake causes a tsunami which damages power lines), whereas scientific models usually try to model just one of these
  processes at a time. The RIESGOS team in collaboration with DLR, have exposed several scientific models as WPS and combined them in a
  simple web-frontend to allow for a more holistic approach to multi step risk management.
  
   * Cloud-based service to monitor ground surface movements using Sentinel-1 SAR image
   Project engineer Moritz Seidel from [Geosystems GmbH](https://www.geosystems.de/) will talk us through their cloud-based Geo
   information service designed for the precise monitoring of ground surface deformation, infrastructure stability and areas subject to
   subsidence or landslides by using the PSI method.
   
   * Monitoring crisis areas in the world using cloud-based satellite imagery
   Pascal Schichor - [European Space Imaging](https://www.euspaceimaging.com/)
   
   * Shruti Kuber, [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/), (Topic will be announced shortly)
   


  * Please volunteer if you would like to speak.

Afterwards the talks there will be a discussion and networking session and we are looking forward to get everyone connected with each other!
