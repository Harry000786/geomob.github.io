Many thanks to everyone who joined us on Tuesday for the first #geomob of the year. It was a night of diverse talks from across the spectrum of start-ups, government, and, by coincidence, two national libraries.  [Vuk](https://twitter.com/vtri) does a good job [summarising things over on his blog](http://vuk.posthaven.com/sketches-from-geomob-january-2014). As ever, good talks was followed by lively discussion over #geobeers. Thank you to the speakers, to our hosts at [the BCS](http://www.bcs.org/) for making the space available, and to the sponsors for making it all possible. 

As we mentioned, as we’ve been contacted by more and more people doing interesting things around geo we’ll be increasing the frequency of #geomob and aiming to have one every two months or so. Let’s see how it goes. We’re fortunate that Google Campus will be having us back on Tuesday the 18th of March. There will be a detailed post with the line-up well before then, but for now [please sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-march/). Similarly, we are starting to put together [our May 13th event](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-may/). If there is someone you think is doing something particularly innovative in geo, please have them get in touch about speaking. 

yours in geo-innovation,

Ed
