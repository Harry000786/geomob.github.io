Once again, Geomob community did not disappoint.

Even on a day with tough competition from other events, Geomob gang turned out in force to see small but select team of cracking presenters:

*   [Vikas](http://twitter.com/#!/vikasar) from [Microsoft Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps "Bing"); 
*   [James](http://twitter.com/spatialanalysis) from [UCL Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/) / [CASA](http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/); and 
*   [Jan](http://www.twitter.com/jansenderek) from [Eeve](http://www.geteeve.com/), an exciting startup just about to launch.

In the case you could not make it to the talks - the presentations are posted on [our Slideshare account.](http://www.slideshare.net/geomobldn)

We’d like to thank all the speakers, attendees and sponsors, including [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com) - the latest addition to the sponsor list.

Have a nice summer and mark your diaries for the [next Geomob - 15th of September](http://lanyrd.com/2011/geomob-september/)!
