Fellow geomobbsters,

the details have now been fleshed out and I’m pleased to report we have a great line up planned for our final #geomob of 2012, which will be held at 18:30 22 November in Room 508 of UCL’s Roberts Building at Torrington Place, London WC1E 7JE . Many thanks to UCL for having us back once again, and to our sponsors [Knowwhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/) and Lokku, makers of [Nestoria](http://www.nestoria.com), who will be fuding the post event beers.

Our speaker list for the evening:

*   [George MacKerron](https://twitter.com/jawj) - [mappiness](http://www.mappiness.org.uk/)
*   [Anna Butler](https://twitter.com/TravelMapmaker) - [WellingtonsTravel](http://www.wellingtonstravel.com/)
*   [Martin Sookael](https://twitter.com/martinsookael) - [Municipality Tools](http://municipalitytools.com/)

*   [Gary Gale](https://twitter.com/vicchi) - [AGI for neo-geos](http://www.agi.org.uk/)

As you can see we’ve expanded from our usual 4 speakers to 6, so we’ll have to keep things moving along. Please arrive on time so we can kick things off on schedule.As always each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to present followed by 2-3 questions from the audience. Please note we are in a different room and building that we have been in in the past, so leave enough time to find it. There’s a map over [on the event Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-november/).

If you can’t join us on the 22nd we look forward to seeing you at the first #geomob of 2013 which will take place at 18:30 on 7th of February. The British Computer Society has very generously made their facilities near Covent Garden available to us. You can see the [speaking and attending list on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-february/) - please do sign up so we can get an idea of the number to expect.

I close by saying I look forward to geobeers with all of you on the 22nd.
