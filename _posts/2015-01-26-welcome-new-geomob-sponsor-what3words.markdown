Great news geomobbers, [what3words](http://what3words.com/) is joining us as a sponsor!  

For those that donâ€™t know what3words is a new, simpler way to communicate location. In true #geomob spirit what3words is not only an innovative geo idea trying to change the world, but also it was invented in London.

Most pleasing for me is that the business has made the transition from #geomob speaker to sponsor: CEO and founder Chris Sheldrick was one of our speakers last May ([you can see all past](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers) [speakers here](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)).  

The company has come a long way since then, and recently relaunched [their website](http://what3words.com/), which I ecourage you all to check out. Perhaps equally relevant to the #geomob audience is that they also much improved [their developer resources](http://developer.what3words.com/). Anyone wishing to learn more should follow [@wha3words](https://twitter.com/what3words) on twitter or [check out their introductory video](http://vimeo.com/112227335).  

Welcome what3words and many thanks! Many thanks also to all of our sponsors who make the post-event beers possible. As I often comment I think the post-talk discussion is often as valuable and stimulating as the speakers, and I encourage all of you to do your best to join in at our next #geomob on [the 19th of March](http://geomobldn.org/post/108481526085/details-of-the-march-19th-geomob).

Until then,
