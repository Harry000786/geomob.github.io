Hi, we just rolled out two new annotations. From immediately every result will have a `MGRS` and a `Maidenhead` location reference code. If you’re not familiar with those codes Wikipedia is a great place to start: ([MGRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_grid_reference_system), [Maidenhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System))

Another small step to try to make lives easy for developers.

As ever, details of all annotations can be found .. [on the API documentation page](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#annotations). Please let us know what other annotations you’d like to see. 

thanks, and happy geocoding
