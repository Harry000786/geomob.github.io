Fellow geomobsters,

I’m pleased to announce a great lineup for this summer’s event which will be held at 18:30 on Thursday the 11th of July. We’re very thankful to Google for once again hosting us at their [Old Street Campus](http://www.campuslondon.com/). We’re lucky to have five great speakers this time so we’ll try to kick off promptly. Please be on time.

The evening’s agenda. 

*   [Noah Veltman](https://twitter.com/veltman) will start us off talking about his [SF Placenames](http://sfstreets.noahveltman.com/) project. 
*   <span></span>[Savio Dimatteo](http://www.saviodimatteo.it) <span>will take us through some of</span> [Nestoria](http://www.nestoria.com/)<span>’s geocoding challenges. </span>
*   Relatedly, [Michael Tandy](http://www.mjt.me.uk/) will talk to us about falsehoods programmers believe about addresses.
*   [Raymond Kenney](https://twitter.com/raymondkenney) from the [MapsData](http://www.mapsdata.co.uk/) team will be showing off their service.
*   And we’ll close with what is sure to be an impressive demo from the [ViziCities](http://vizicities.com) team. 

Many thanks to all the speakers.

As per long standing #geomob tradition the talks will be followed by a visit to a local pub where the geobeers will generously be provided by sponsors [OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com/) and [knowwhere consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/). 

As always, if you can join us please [sign up via the Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-july/) for the event so we can get an estimate of numbers. You’ll also find a map to the venue on that page. 

We look forward to seeing everyone on the 11th. 

Finally, due to all the action around [#maptember](http://www.maptember.org/), our autumn event won’t be until October. More details to follow here and via [our twitter feed](https://twitter.com/geomob) (you do follow us, right?). If you would like to speak or if you know of anyone who should speak, please get in touch.
