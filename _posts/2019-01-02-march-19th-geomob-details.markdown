Our second #geomob of 2019 will be at 18:30 (as always) on Tuesday the 
19th of March, 2019. 

Yet again long time #geomob supporter
[Muki Hakley](https://twitter.com/mhaklay) of
[UCL's ExCiteS research group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/excites)
has made it possible for us
to use the excellent facilities of UCL. We will be back in the
[B05 Lecture Theatre in the Chadwick Building](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/chadwick-building). 

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
[Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/),
[Localistico](https://localistico.com/),
[Mappery](http://mappery.org),
[Navenio](https://www.navenio.com),
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/), 
and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).
Thank you sponsors! 

Our speakers on the evening of the 19th will be:

* [Steven Feldman](https://twitter.com/StevenFeldman) returns with a presentation entitled "So, you want me to invest in your geo start-up"

* [Karolina Alexiou](https://twitter.com/_sandtweets) poses the question "Is London a Forest? How to Use GIS and Open Data to Find Out."

* [David Piesse](https://twitter.com/mapdev) returns to present "Simple, Lovable, Complete - Building a geo SaaS to fix a problem"

* [Dan Stowell](https://twitter.com/mclduk) asks "_Where *exactly* are the solar panels_"

* [Dominic Stubbins](https://twitter.com/DomStubbins) will tell us about "_Ways different organisations are using AI to solve spatial problems_".

* [Tomas Holderness](https://twitter.com/iHolderness) of [Addresscloud](https://www.addresscloud.com) will talk about "Faster Rasters in The Cloud".


All that, and geobeers! A geo good time is guaranteed.

If you can't make it in March, our next event after that will be in mid-June. We are still confirming the exact date/venue. Please get in touch if you would like to volunteer to speak.

I look forward to seeing you all at UCL on the 19th of March,
