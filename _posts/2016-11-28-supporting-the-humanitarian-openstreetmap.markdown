Friends,

it’s been a great year here at OpenCage. Many thanks to all of our clients around the world for their trust and support in making our service possible.

As a gesture of appreciation of their belief in us we’re delighted to announce that we’ve made a donation of €1000 to the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org) as part of [their end of year funding drive](http://donate.hotosm.org). For those who aren’t aware of the great work HOT does, they help coordinate volunteer mapping in crisis regions around the world.

Sitting at a keyboard all day it’s easy to focus on the techncial aspects of location and forget just what a critical core piece of infrastructure good geo data is. Many places of the world unfortunately still lack this key tool and/or need to have their data updated after a crisis. HOT and their team of thousands of volunteers help create the map to solve the crisis. I encourage all of you to learn more about their work and to get involved, and if possible donate to the funding drive.

On a personal level, it’s great that we’ve reached the stage where we can carry on [the tradition of donating to HOT that we started at Lokku](https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-01-04_thank_you_lokku_and_happy_new_year), the company OpenCage was spun out of. It’s a great milestone for your business. We look forward to growing, and growing the amount we can give back, next year.

thanks for your support, Ed ([freyfogle](https://twitter.com/freyfogle))
