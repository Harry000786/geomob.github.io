Two weeks ago I spoke at [#APIconUK](http://www.apiconuk.com/), an event about APIs and API business models here in London organised by the good folks at [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/).  

<span>In my talk I of course focused on the OpenCage geocoding API, but the goal was to explore a more general topic that would be of interest to a wider API developer audience. Specifically is it possible to build a sustainable business around open data? The challenge of course being that the underlying inputs (in our case geodata) is free for all. So how can we add enough value on top of the data for a customer to justify paying us on an ongoing basis?</span>

<span>Here’s a video of my talk, I hope you enjoy it. All feedback of course gladly accepted. </span>
