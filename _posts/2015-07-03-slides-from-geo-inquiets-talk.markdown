Last night it was my pleasure to talk about our geocoder and a few other georelated thoughts at [Geo Inquiets](http://geoinquiets.cat/), the meetup of Catalan geo enthusiasts. Many thanks to them for having me and for the enjoyable geobeers afterwards.

Here are the slides of my talk.

Unfortunately I didn’t have the chance to show the [What3Words](https://vimeo.com/123205044) video or the [SplashMaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsiBdJ-XsoE) video, but they are now linked here. 

It seems the Catalonian government had, only the day before, announced a move to make much of their data available openly, and there was much discussion of how or if this might be incorporated in OpenStreetMap. Unfortunately I can’t seem to find a link in English of the announcement, but it’s great news nonetheless. 

Overall a very enjoyable evening and I look forward to the next event. Thanks once again to the organisers. I encourage anyone interested in the Catalan geo scene to follow [@geoinquiets](https://twitter.com/geoinquiets) on twitter.   

For those looking for similar geoevents, I remind you that the next #geomob, the geo innovation event we organise and sponsor, will [be taking place in London on the 15th](http://geomobldn.org/post/122756697890/thanks-esri-uk-for-becoming-a-geomob-sponsor). We hope to see you there.
