More good news on the library front - if [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is your thing you can now query the API using the [node-geocoder library](http://nchaulet.github.io/node-geocoder/)! As ever all the various libraries for accessing the API are listed on the cleverly named [libraries page](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html). Please let us know if you create a library, we will gladly feature it here.

happy geocoding everyone,

Ed
