Hard to believe, my dear geofriends, but in 2018 #geomob will enter its tenth
year!


Many thanks to all who have helped make it happen. 

We'll enter our second decade with an event at 18:30 on the evening of Tuesday,
23rd of January, 2018. We're fortunate to be able to once again call upon the
generous hospitality of our good friends at
[the BCS](http://geospatial.bcs.org/lisg/).

As the seating available is finite, 
**[please register on the event page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/geomob-january-23rd-2018-tickets-39957288325)** so we can have a sense of how many people will be attending.

Our format will be the same as ever: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory. Then we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our generous sponsors: [CARTO](https://carto.com), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), [KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).

Our speakers for the evening:

* [Max Stephan](https://twitter.com/GeospatialMax) will share [CityCycler](https://citycycler.cc/) with us

* next we'll hear from [Olivia Mather](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-mather-4b64a2141/) of [OpenSensors](https://opensensors.com)

* [Isambard Poulson](https://twitter.com/ipoulson) will tell us about [huq](https://huq.io)

* #geomob veteran [Nina Tumanishvili](https://twitter.com/ninachinoo) returns to present [TubeChat App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tubechat/id1231933096?mt=8)

* Yet another #geomob veteran, [Chris Thorpe](https://twitter.com/jaggeree), will return to reveal [Bimble](https://bimblehq.com/)

* and finally, [Steven Feldman](https://twitter.com/StevenFeldman) will give us a condensed version of his much heralded "FAKE MAPS! very dishonest" talk, originally presented at FOSS4G 2017.

See you at the BCS on the 23rd of January, and looking forward to a great
second decade of #geomob!
