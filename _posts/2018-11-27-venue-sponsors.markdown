Friends,

as the year winds down I want to take the chance to say thank you the various 
venues that host #geomob. Without these partners making their facilities 
available to us our events would simply not be possible.

First up, we have [Geovation](https://geovation.uk/), a start-up accelerator 
based in Clerkenwell. Sponsored by the Ordnance Survey and the UK Land 
Registry, Geovation provides start-ups with grant funding, hands-on assistance, 
and office space. Over the years many different Geovation start-ups have 
spoken at #geomob, and indeed Geovation alumni [Flock has even gone on to be a #geomob sponsor](/post/flock-sponsors-geomob). 

I strongly encourage anyone in London thinking of doing a location-based  
or proptech start-up to investigate Geovation's compelling offering.

Our next #geomob - [on 16th Jan, 2019](/post/jan-16th-2019-geomob-details) - 
will be at Geovation.

Next, we need to thank UCL's Geography Department, and especially 
[Prof. Muki Hakley](https://twitter.com/mhaklay) for hosting #geomob too many 
times to count over the years. UCL is where OpenStreetMap was 
invented, and it is great that by having #geomob there we can do a small part 
to carry on the tradition of geo-innovaton. Many long-standing members of
the #geomob community have connections to UCL in one form or another, but 
it's also always nice to invite the next generation of students into our 
community as well.

Last, but by no means least, we're fotunate to benefit from the generosity of 
the [British Computing Society (BCS)](https://www.bcs.org) who occasionally 
host us at their excellent Covent Garden facility. We're very appreciative of 
the long-standing support of this well respected industry body as a basis for 
our geo-experimentation.

Thank you to all of our venue sponsors for making #geomob possible.

And to all 
[sponsors](/sponsorship), 
[speakers](/past-speakers), and 
attendees for helping create #geomob as a forum for geo-innovation.

I look forward to seeing you all in 2019,
