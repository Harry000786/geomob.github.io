The details are now clear for the next #geomob which will take place at 18:30 on Tuesday the 4th of November. We’ll once again be at the BCS at 5 Southampton Street near Covent Garden, many thanks to them for their continued support. Please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-nov/) so we have a sense of the numbers to expect.

The format will be the same as ever - each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to share their material followed then by 5 minutes of audience questions. At the end of the evening those who wish can keep the discussion going at a nearby pub over #geobeers generously funded by our sponsors (Thank you!).

On the 4th of November we’ll be hearing from:

- [Robin Hawkes](https://twitter.com/robhawkes) will make his second #geomob appearance talking about his app to automatically determine building height.

- [Dan Stowell](https://twitter.com/mclduk) will share his [feet from a rat](http://mcld.co.uk/feet-from-a-rat) project

- [Gail Ramster](https://twitter.com/gaillyk) will lift the curtain on [the Great British Public Toilet Map](http://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/)

- [Stefano Maggiolo](https://twitter.com/zzzviad) will talk about geography and time

<span>As always, at the end of the evening attendees will vote by show of hands for the best speaker who will be awarded with a free</span> [SplashMap](http://www.splash-maps.com/)<span>. The non-winners will have to console themselves with free beer.</span>

We hope you agree it has all the makings of a great evening and look forward to seeing you at 18:30 on the 4th.

Many thanks to everyone who attended our event this past week. [Richard Fairhurst](https://twitter.com/richardf) took home the SplashMaps best speaker prize for his presentation about cycle routing on [cycle.travel](http://cycle.travel/). Congratulations to him, but also to all of the other speakers for their well received presentations.

See you in November!
