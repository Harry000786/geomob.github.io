Fellow geomobsters,

We’re just two and a half weeks from [our next meeting on the 25th](http://geomobldn.org/post/44291757142/spring-geomob-25th-of-april-at-ucl), but it’s never too early to start plotting a future #geomob. As such we’ve set he date and location for summer event: on July 11th at 18:30 we’ll be back at Google’s east London Campus. Please [sign up on Lanyrd if you will be attending](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-july/). Many thanks to the good folks at Google for hosting us once again. 

The first speaker has already been found, but we’re hard on the hunt for more. Please let us know if you have something interesting to present or if you’d like to recommend someone else. 

We look forward to seeing everyone in two weeks at UCL, and then again in July.
