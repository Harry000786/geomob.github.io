Fellow geoenthusiasts,

I’m delighted to write that [Esri UK](http://www.esriuk.com/) has joined the #geomob family as our newest sponsor. If you work in geo you are familiar with Esri, the world’s leading supplier of GIS software. Their sponsorship is a great endorsement of the #geomob community, and perfectly matches our desire to be the meet up for anyone in London doing anything innovative in geo, be it for fun or profit, be they a hobbyist, a start-up, academic, or a globally known geo brand.  

Of particular interest to the #geomob crew might be the  [Esri Startup Program](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/startups/), which is a three year program to help emerging businesses. Please check it out.

Past #geomob speaker and Esri UK developer evangelist [James Milner](https://twitter.com/JamesLMilner) will be on hand at our next event ([at 18:30 July 15th at the BCS, see you there](http://geomobldn.org/post/120609751325/july-15th-geomob-lineup)), to answer any and all Esri questions, and hopefully there will also be a strong turn out from his colleagues. If that’s just too long to wait I encourage you to start following [@esriuk](https://twitter.com/esriuk) on twitter to learn more. 

Please join me in thanking Esri UK and all of our sponsors for their generosity. It is only through their support that #geomob is possible. If your brand is interesting in sponsoring #geomob, please get in touch.

Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you all on the 15th,
