Great news, two new libraries to access the geocoding API have been made by members of the community!

Many thanks go out to [Jürgen Hahn](https://twitter.com/hahnjuergen) for [his Haskell library](https://github.com/juergenhah/Haskell-Geocoder-OpenCage) and [Hakan Tandogan](http://blog.gurkensalat.com) for [a java library](https://github.com/hakan42/java-opencage-geocoder). We really appreciate it and will be sending both appropriate gifts (custom [SplashMaps](http://splash-maps.com/)) in the near future (once SplashMaps launches outside of the UK, which should happen very soon). 

Both libraries are open source, and I am sure pull requests would be much appreciated. 

All the various libraries, those made by us and those made by others, are documented [over on the libraries page](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html). We’d of course love to see more for the languages we don’t yet cover.

thanks again guys, and happy geocoding everyone
