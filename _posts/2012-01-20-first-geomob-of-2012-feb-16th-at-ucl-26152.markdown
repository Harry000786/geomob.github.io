Fellow geomobbers, I digitally come before you today with good news: we’ve finalized the line up for our first event of 2012 and I believe you’ll agree that we are in for a geotreat (and I’m not just refering to the post event geobeers).

First of all, let us again thank our gracious hosts, [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk/), who have generously allowed us to return. On the evening of Thursday, February the 16th, things will kick off at 18:30 in [G07 in the Chadwick](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.524&mlon=-0.133890&zoom=18&layers=M). As at past events we’ll have some signs up on campus directing you. Please arrive on time so we can get started promptly. Also, please register at [the event page over on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-february-2/).

Ok, enough organisational chit chat, let’s move on to our lineup for the evening:

*   <span class="name">Anna Powell-Smith will discuss her work on</span> <span>[DomesdayMap](http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/).</span> 

*   Bertrand Clerc and <span class="gI"><span class="gD">Benedikt Gross will be discussing their work on [Mashing up OSM and Mental Maps](http://www.looksgood.de/log/2011/10/mapmap-vauxhall-mashup-mental-maps-and-openstreetmap/).</span></span> 

*   Ed Freyfogle will discuss [Nestoria’s recent switch from Google Maps to OSM](http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/why-and-how-weve-switched-away-from-google-ma).

*   Matt Amos of [MapQuest Open](http://open.mapquestapi.com/) will give us a peak behind their tech curtain.

As usual the format will be a very brief intro, then each speaker will present for 10-15 minutes with a few minutes for questions, and the mob will then retire to the [the Jeremy Bentham](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/66/666/Jeremy_Bentham/Bloomsbury) for discussion and geobeers graciously subsidised by our sponsor [Lokku](http://www.lokku.com/).

One final note, if you like geomob, you may well be interested in the [London Citizen Cyberscience Summit](http://lccs2.eventbrite.com/) also being held at UCL on the 17th and 18th. Please check it out.

We look forward to seeing everyone on February 16th.
