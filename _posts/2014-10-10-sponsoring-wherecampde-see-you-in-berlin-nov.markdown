Hi everyone,

great news, [WhereCamp](http://wherecamp.de/) is taking place in Berlin from the 13th -15th of November and the OpenCage team will be there. Hopefully we’ll have the chance to give a talk about what we’ve been up to. If past WhereCamps are any indicator it will be a great event, if you’re doing something interesting in geo please consider giving a talk - you have until the 15th of October to apply.

I’m also proud to say our parent company, [Lokku](http://lokku.com/), is again [sponsoring the event](http://wherecamp.de/post/99558630253/lokku-long-time-supporters-of-geo-innovation), continuing our [long tradition of sponsoring geo-innovation](http://blog.lokku.com/post/86345846298/giving-back). Even better news is that [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/), which Lokku seed invested in last year, will be awarding prizes to the three best speakers, as chosen by the audience, to celebrate their much anticipated international launch.

Many thanks to the organisers for putting together what will surely be a great event, I look forward to seeing everyone. As part of our interview series [we spoke with Jan Nowak](http://blog.opencagedata.com/post/95809903843/open-geo-interview-series-jan-nowak), one of the organisers, back in August. Give it a read to get some more background on WhereCamp.

bis bald in Berlin,
