The next #geomob will be at 18:30 on Tuesday the 19th of September,  we’ll be back at [Traveltech Lab](http://thetrampery.com/workspaces/traveltech-lab/) by Tower Bridge, specifically at [6th Floor, 2 More London Riverside, London SE1 2RR](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.505232602357864&mlon=-0.08056014776229858#map=17/51.50523/-0.08056). 

Please sign up [on the Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-september/) so we have a sense of the numbers to expect.   

The format is the same as always. Five speakers, each will have 10-15 minutes to present and then a few minutes for questions. At the end we will vote to determine the coveted [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/) best speaker prize. Then we will head to a nearby pub for discussion and geobeers. All of that is made possibly by the generosity of our sponsors, who you should immediately support 

We will hear from:

*   [Alexis Batlle](https://twitter.com/AlexisBatlle), co-founder of [AVUXI](http://www.avuxi.com/)  

*   [Tim Fernando](https://twitter.com/timfernando), returns to #geomob to update us on the impressive progress of [esplorio](https://esplor.io/)
*   Jo Eckersley, will tell us about [Bubbl](http://bubbl.tech/)
*   [Rutger Geelen](https://twitter.com/rutgergeelen), co-founder of [SchedJoules](https://www.schedjoules.com/) 
*   [Tom Charman](https://twitter.com/CharmanTom), co-founder of [KOMPAS](https://www.kompasapp.com/)
*   [Manuel Timita](https://twitter.com/manueltimita), creator of [illustreets](http://illustreets.com/) 

If you can’t make it on the 19th of September (and indeed even if you can!) our next #geomob will be [on the 25th of October back at Geovation in Clerkenwell](https://geomob-october-2017.confetti.events/). Please get in touch if you would like to speak! We extend a particular welcome to attendees of [#GeoCom17](http://www.agi.org.uk/events/calendar/geocom17) which will be the following day. 

And with that I wish you all a great summer and look forward to seeing you on the 19th of September.
