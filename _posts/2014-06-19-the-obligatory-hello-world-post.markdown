Welcome to the [OpenCage](http://www.opencagedata.com/) blog. Here you’ll find the occasional thoughts, news and musings from the team behind [OpenCage Data](http://data.opencagedata.com/) and the [OpenCage geocoder](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/).

Why OpenCage? OpenCage is part of [Lokku](http://www.lokku.com/) and we use a _lot_ of open data. We really do mean a lot as well. Open data is amazing but it’s also wrapped up in a metaphorical cage that you sometimes need to be a bit of an expert to unlock. We’re doing our best to open up that metaphorical cage for you.

Here’s a great example of open data in action. We think the best way to say hello world is with a map, of the world, from open data and in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), an open data format.

Take a look at Johan Sundström’s [world.geo.json](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json); truly open data, truly open geo data and totally what we think OpenCage is all about.

So hello world. We’ll be right back with more musings from the team.
