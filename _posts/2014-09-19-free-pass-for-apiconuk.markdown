Hi, 

next Thursday (25th of Sept) I’ll be speaking at [#APIconUK](http://www.apiconuk.com/) here in London. It’s a three day conference targeting anyone using or developing APIs organised by the good folks behind [ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/).

I have one free pass for all three days to give away, first person to comment here can have it. 

If you can’t make it to London fear not. the talks will be recorded I’ll post my slides here once I have them ready.
