I’m pleased to announce I’ll be speaking about the OpenCage geocoder at the 39th Geoinquiets on the 2nd of July. [Tickets and details of the event are available here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/39a-geoinquiets-2-de-juliol-de-2015-the-opencage-geocoder-an-api-based-geocoding-service-built-on-tickets-17083050865), if you’re in Barcelona please come along, I am sure it will be an interesting evening. As my Catalan is not yet quite fluent, I’ll be speaking in English, and will post the slides here on the blog afterwards. 

In other event news Marc Tobias will be attending [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) in New York City next week. If you’re there please say hello. [The lineup](http://stateofthemap.us/program/) looks fantastic, and the organizers seems to be going to great efforts to ensure it will be a great conference.

Finally, the [next #geomob will be the evening of July 15th](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-july/) in London. Hope to see you there.   

ciao,
