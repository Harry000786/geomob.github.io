Many thanks to everyone who has started testing the geocoder and sent us feedback. If you haven’t yet here’s the [quick start guide](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#quickstart). 

We know we still have a long way to go, and one question that has come up is that we’ll work on first. In the sprit of openness that underlies our service we thought we’d put the list out in the public. You can find it in [the opencagedata-roadmap github repo](https://github.com/lokku/opencagedata-roadmap). This will be a high level overview of the general direction of our work. Obviously it might change, especially depending on the requests of our customers, but this at least gives an idea of what we’re thinking. Plase let us know what you think.

yours in geocorrectness,
