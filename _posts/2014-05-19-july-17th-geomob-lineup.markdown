We’ve now nailed down the lineup of the July 17th #geomob. I’m pleased to report the evening (as per tradition we will kick off at 18:30, please do your best to be on time) will feature:

*   <span>[George Coltart](https://twitter.com/georgecoltart) of [Mapbrush](http://www.mapbrush.com/)</span>
*   <span>[Ian Holt](https://twitter.com/IanHolt) of [Ordnance Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/)</span>
*   <span>[Kass Schmitt](https://twitter.com/kassschmitt), Mapping the wind</span>
*   <span>[Gareth Wood](https://twitter.com/GarethJWood) of [Fuller Maps](http://www.fullermaps.com/)</span>
*   <span>[James Siddle](https://twitter.com/jamessiddle) telling us about _Stories in Travel Data_</span>
*   <span>[Ed Manley](https://twitter.com/edthink) of [CASA](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa)</span>

As always a diverse mix of topics from across the spectrum of geo-innovation. We’ll be back at Google’s Campus near Old Street, a map can be found on [the lanyrd page for the evening](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-july/), where you should also please sign up. In terms of format, there will be no deviation from tried and true tradition. Each speaker will share his or her material for 10-15 minutes, there will be questions from the audience, and at the end of the evening we will will vote by show of hands on the best speaker who will receive [a custom SplashMap](http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/). Afterwards we will all head to the pub. 

And on that note, congratulation to Andrew Brown (in photo below) of [Toursome](http://tourso.me/) who won the best speaker prize at last week’s #geomob.

Many thanks to all the speakers, our hosts UCL, and of course the sponsors ([OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com/), [knowwhere consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splashmaps.net/)) for another fine #geomob. 

On a final note - for all who like to get a jump on things, [the signup page for the 16th September #geomob](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-september/) has opened, and the lineup is looking particularly strong. 

I look forward to seeing all of you on the 17th of July. 

yours in geo-innovation,
