Hail fellow geomobsters!

In just over a month, on Tuesday the 18th of March, we’ll be gathering once again to celebrate geoinnovation in any and all forms. We return to [Campus](http://www.campuslondon.com/), Google’s co-working/events space near Old Street. A map and all details can be found over on [the Lanyrd page for the evening](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-march/), where we also ask that you sign up so we can get an idea of numbers.

The evening will kick off at 18:30, please be on time as we are fortunate to have a great lineup of speakers to get through before the obligatory post-event geobeers. As always, each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to share their work and then there will be a few minutes for questions from the audience. 

Our lineup on the 18th:

*   In what will no doubt be a feast for the eyes, [Jason Davies](http://www.jasondavies.com/) has finally been persuaded to show off some of his D3 geo magic.
*   [Emil](https://twitter.com/EmilLondon) of [CityMapper](http://citymapper.com/) will update us on their progress as they help the world get from A to B.
*   Tubefreaks will get their fix as [Peter Lloyd](http://www.linkedin.com/in/peterblloyd) will tell us about the evolution of the New York City subway map. 
*   Start-up [LEMON](http://www.lemonllc.com) will talk us through their spin on location based services. 
*   Andy Ashburner will tell us about his app [Pin Drop](http://www.pindropapp.com/). 
*   Finally, [Benjamin Hennig](https://twitter.com/geoviews) of Oxford’s [School of Geography and Environment](http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/bhennig.html) will share with us one of his many interesting projects around spatial data analysis and data-visualization

Many thanks to all of the speakers for their time and volunteering to speak. As ever, we’re every thankful to our sponsors - K[nowWhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), [OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splashmaps.net/) for making the post talk geobeers happen. In the start of a new tradition, the audience will vote on best speaker and the winner will receive a [personalised SplashMap](http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/).

If you unfortunately can’t make it on the 18th, or even if you can - please put our 13th of May event in the diary. [The Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-may/) is here, we will be back at UCL and the evening has the makings of a great one as we already have several intriguing  speakers. Please send suggestions if you know of anyone who should speak at a future event. 

Please stay tuned for updates by following [@geomob](https://twitter.com/geomob)​ on twitter. 

We look forward to seeing you on the 18th of March!
