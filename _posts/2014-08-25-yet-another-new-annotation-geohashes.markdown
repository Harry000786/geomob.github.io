Hi everyone,

summer break is over and the OpenCage team is back. Today we’ve rolled out another new [annotation](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#annotations), this time `geohash`. A geohash is a way to represent a long/lat via a single string with arbitrary precision. This can be very useful, amongst other things for representing geodata in some types of databases.

As always, [Wikipedia is a great reference to learn more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash), as is [geohash.org](http://geohash.org). 

Enjoy, all feedback welcome
