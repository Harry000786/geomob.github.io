Fellow geomobsters,

I hope the summer is treating you all well. 

Our next event will take place on the evening of the 30th of September. As always we’ll kick off at 18:30, and likewise we shall stick to our time honored formula: 5-6 speakers from across the gamut of those doing interesting things in London in geo.

We’ll be back at UCL in the Pearson Lecture Theatre, there is a map [on the Lanyrd page for the event](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-september/) (please sign up so we can get a sense of the numbers). I’d like to explicitly thank longtime friend of #geomob [Muki Hakley](https://twitter.com/mhaklay) Professor of Geographical Information Science at UCL for once again making their facilities available to us. It is only through such generosity that #geomob is possible. Muki you are ace!

I am pleased to announce our speakers for the evening:

*   [Gareth Wood](https://twitter.com/GarethJWood) of [Fuller Maps](http://www.fullermaps.com/) will show off some of his hand drawn map work.  

*   [Jonny Britton](https://twitter.com/JonnyBritton), co-founder of [LandInsight](http://www.landinsight.io/) will tell us about their work.   

*   [Abdul Shahid](https://twitter.com/abdulrshahid) will report on some of his research into crowd sourced mapping. 
*   [Charlie Davies](https://twitter.com/charliedavi) of [iGeolise](http://www.igeolise.com/) will share what they are up to
*   [Steven Goodwin](http://marquisdegeek.com/) will tell us about his “Flight Composer” hack
*   [Tom Timms](https://twitter.com/TomTheMap) will close things out by taking a bit about one of the projects he works on at the [GeoInformation Group](http://www.geoinformationgroup.co.uk/)

Following the talks we will, as always, vote for the SplashMaps best speaker and then head to a nearby pub where the drinks will be paid for by our sponsors. Please check our their services and let the world know how great they are.  

As one example of many of how great our sponsors are, and as an added incentive to join us on the 30th, [our new sponsor Esri UK](http://geomobldn.org/post/122756697890/thanks-esri-uk-for-becoming-a-geomob-sponsor) will be raffling off a beautiful book on map design to all attendees in what we hope to make a new #geomob tradition.

One final point, for those who can’t wait until the 30th of September to get their geo fix, keep in mind that [GeoHackDay](http://geohackdays.com/) is happening on the 5th of September.   

See you on the 30th of September at UCL,
