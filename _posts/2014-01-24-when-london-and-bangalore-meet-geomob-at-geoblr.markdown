The love and language of maps is truly an international thing that spans countries, nationalities, cultures and language. To underpin this, [Ed](https://twitter.com/freyfogle) and myself are taking the #geomob London experience to Bangalore in India, where we’ll be hosted by fellow map lovers [GeoBLR](http://geoblr.in/meetup/special-edition-with-gary-gale-and-ed-freyfogle/).

I’ll be recapping the [Vaguely Rude Places Map](http://maps.geotastic.org/vaguely-rude-places/index.php) talk I gave at [#geomob in April of 2013](http://www.vicchi.org/2013/04/26/how-a-map-can-go-viral/), whilst Ed will be talking about the challenges facing geocoders in India.

If you’re in Bangalore next week, we’ll be at 7 High Street, Cooke Town at 6.00 PM on January 31st. If you’ve been to a GeoBLR meetup before, we’re looking forwards to meeting you; if you haven’t, then what are you waiting for?
