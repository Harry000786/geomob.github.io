Great news geomobsters: Ordnance Survey is [opening a new innovation hub in Clerkenwell](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/hub/index.html). Even better news - our next #geomob will be held there! I look forward to seeing you all there at 18:30 on the evening of Tuesday, May 19th. While the venue will be new, our format for the evening will be the time-tested norm; 6 speakers will each have 10-15 minutes to present their slides and answer a few questions from the audience. Afterwards we will retire to a nearby pub to discuss. 

We’re fortunate to already have a great lineup for the evening. We’ll hear from: 

*   [Jez Nicholson](https://twitter.com/jnicho02) about [Open Plaques](http://openplaques.org/)
*   [Andy Allan](https://twitter.com/gravitystorm) of [Thunderforest](http://thunderforest.com/)
*   Mark Berry will talk about [Windmill World](http://www.windmillworld.com/) - using geo tools and resources to research and present historic windmills.
*   [Grant Slater](https://twitter.com/firefishy1) will present about the challenge of operations at OpenStreetMap
*   [Krishan Patel](http://www.krishan711.com/) will tell us about [Kitesapp](http://www.kitesapp.com/)   

*   [Jerry Clough](http://sk53-osm.blogspot.co.uk/) will close out the evening by telling us about one of his many OpenStreetMap experiments. 

I hope you agree it’s a strong list of speakers. If you’ll be able to join us please [sign up on the lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-may/) so we get an idea of the numbers. 

If, for whatever reason, you can’t join us on May 19th our next event after that will be on Wednesday July 15th when our friends at the BCS have once again agreed to host us. [Signup is now open for the evening](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-july/). We have a few speakers already, but volunteers remain very welcome.

As a final point I want to apologise for the crowded conditions at the pub at our last event. It was far from good. Rest assured all efforts are being taken to ensure our choose of pub for the May event works out better.

I look forward to seeing you all on the 19th of May!
