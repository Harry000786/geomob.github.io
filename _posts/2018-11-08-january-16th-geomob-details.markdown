Congratulation to [David Heyman](https://twitter.com/davidheyman) of

speaker prize at [the November 7th #geomob](/post/nov-7th-2018-geomob-details)

Our next #geomob will be at 18:30 (as always) on Wednesday the 
16th of January, 2019. 
Our good friends at [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/hub/) 
will once again be hosting us at their impressive new venue (_[Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975)_).

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
[Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/),
[Flock](https://flockcover.com), 
[KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/),
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/), 
and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).
Thank you sponsors! 

Our speakers on the evening of the 16th will be:

*  [Tim Weil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tweil/), who will share [Navenio](https://www.navenio.com)'s indoor location solutions

*  [Peter Rose](https://twitter.com/the_peter_rose), who will show us [Orbica](https://orbica.world)

*  [Russ Garrett](https://twitter.com/russss), who will present [OpenInfraMap](https://openinframap.org)

*  [Abigail Page](https://twitter.com/abi_edin), who will tell us about [OpenELS](https://openels.eu)

*  [David Murray](https://www.davidmurray.media/), presenting [InYourArea](https://www.inyourarea.co.uk)

It promises to be yet another interesting evening. For those looking to get a 
jump on their planning, our next #geomob after that
[will be Tuesday, the 19th of March](/post/mar-19th-2019-geomob-details), when
we will be back at UCL. After that will be mid-June.
Please get in touch if you would like to volunteer to speak.

Enjoy the holidays, and I look forward to seeing you at Geovation on the 16th 
of January,
