Many thanks to one and all that came to [our September event](http://geomobldn.org/post/148317905840/back-at-the-bcs-for-the-7th-sept-geomob). The next #geomob will be 18:30 on Wednesday the 2nd of November. The good folks at [the BCS](http://www.bcs.org/) have once again agreed to host us in their facilities at 5 Southampton Street, near Covent Garden. [Please sign up on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-november/) so we can have an idea of the numbers. 

We have a great lineup set for the evening. As always each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to explain their project, then field a few questions from the audience. At the end we’ll vote for the best speaker and head to a nearby pub for #geobeers generously paid for by our generous sponsors.

Our speakers on the evening will be:

*   [Nick Bearman](https://twitter.com/NickBearmanUK) of [Clear Mapping](http://www.clearmapping.co.uk/)
*   [Christina Franken](https://twitter.com/DScientificly) of [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
*   [Richard Worthington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-worthington-3589bb42) of [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) discussing their API of listed buildings
*   [Andrew Larcombe](https://twitter.com/andrewl) will tell us about some of his experiments in flight tracking
*   [Dominic Humphrey](https://twitter.com/dominijk) speaks to us about his work on the Greater London NationalParkCity map.

Please let us know if you’d like to present at a future event.

If you can’t make it in November, [our first #geomob of 2017 will be Wednesday the 25th of January](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob/), location still to be determined. On [Wednesday the 29th of March we’ll be back the Geovation Hub](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-march/) in Clerkenwell. 

See you all on November 2nd,
