Good news everyone, thanks to the coding efforts of [Demeter Sztanko](http://about.me/sztanko) (more usually known as Dimi), [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy), a python library for accessing various geocoding services, now supports the OpenCage geocoder. Many thanks Dimi! For those that don’t know Dimi, he is the creator of [walks.io](http://walks.io/), and several other [very cool geo-based projects](http://sztanko.github.io/solsticestreets/), and a regular in the London #geomob scene. I can recommend [following him on twitter](https://twitter.com/sztanko). 

All of the various libraries for accessing our geocoder are listed on our cleverly named [libraries page](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html), (including a python library). They are all open-source and [over on github](https://github.com/lokku), and we’d love your patches. We have libraries for several popular scripting languages, but of course would welcome more contributions. If you write one please let us know, we will gladly feature it here, on twitter, etc.

happy geocoding,

Ed
