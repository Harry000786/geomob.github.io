Hi everyone, 

only one month to go until our next #geomob! We look forward to seeing you all at 18:30 on Tuesday the 15th of March. Our good friends at UCL have generously agreed to host us once again, we will be in the Chadwick Building, there will be signs up (Thanks [Muki](https://twitter.com/mhaklay)!). [Please sign up on lanyrd if you will be attending](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-march/) so we can get an estimate of the numbers.

For those attending for the first time, our format is as follows: we invite 5-6 speakers doing interesting projects in some way related to geo. Each speaker has 10-15 minutes to present and then takes a few questions from the audience. At the end we vote by show of hands for the best speaker who wins a map from [our sponsor SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/). Then we all head to the pub to talk about what we learned. The drinks are paid for by our sponsors (if you are an innovative geo brand, [please become a sponsor](http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship)). I’m obviously a bit biased, but I can honestly say a good time is had by all. 

On the 15th of March our speakers for the evening will be:

*   [Jeremy Morley](https://twitter.com/jeremy_morley) will tell us about his research at the Ordnance Survey  

*   [Chaz Hutton](https://twitter.com/chazhutton) will tell us his experience [drawing “a map of every city” and then having it go viral](https://medium.com/@chazhutton/drawing-the-map-of-every-city-f4b4ea7fa58f). 
*   #geomob veteran [Anna Powell-Smith](https://twitter.com/darkgreener) is back to talk about her work visualising offshore property purchasing in the UK 
*   [Andy Murdock](https://twitter.com/APMurdock) will talk about [OpenPopGrid](http://openpopgrid.geodata.soton.ac.uk/) 
*   [Ricardo Varela](https://twitter.com/phobeo) will present his start-up [Localistico](http://localistico.com/) and how they try to help business locations bridge physical and digital presence
*   Martin Traunmueller of UCL will be discussing his work on walkability and [the Likeways App](https://twitter.com/LikewaysApp). 

I hope you agree it looks like a great line-up. Many thanks to all of our speakers and for our sponsors and hosts for making it possible. 

I look forward to seeing you on the 15th of March at 18:30
