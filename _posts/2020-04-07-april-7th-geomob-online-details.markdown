<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST on Wednesday the 7th of April 2020. This will be
our first ever online event. We're very fortunate to be able to use the
Zoom account of our good friends at [Geovation](https://geovation.uk/).
Thank you! With that account we have space for about 100 people to watch
the talks. A sign up form will go out in the early-April [Geomob newsletter](https://thegeomob.com/mailing-list), and we will invite people to the live event
based on whoever signed up first. Sorry we don't have a more fair way to do it.

<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

Our format for the evening will be as close to the format of our in-person
events as possible. That said, please bear with us as we are doing this for
the first time.

* Before the event please make sure you have [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) installed.

* at 19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST we begin the talks with a very brief introduction

* Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.

* Afterwards we will vote by twitter poll for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

* Following the event we will unfortunately NOT be able to head to a pub for
discussion and #geobeers. Feel free to post your questions on twitter (tagged
with the hashtag #geomob). And feel free to enjoy a #geobeer while watching the talks. 

* Assuming the speakers give thier permisison we will hopefully be able to
post recordings of the talks in the near future. Again, have patience as it is our first ever online event.
