Many thanks to everyone who came along
[on the evening of September 6th](/post/sept-6th-2018-geomob-details) to the
most recent #geomob. I was delighted to see long time #geomob contributor
[Gary Gale](https://twitter.com/vicchi) take home the SplashMaps best
speaker prize. Congrats, Gary!

I would be remiss not to mention the fantastic (and tasty!) work of speaker
[Kenneth Field](https://twitter.com/kennethfield) who won much praise for his
geo cheeseboard. Thank you Kenneth!

Our next #geomob will be on Wednesday the 7th of November, at 18:30 (as always).

Once again long time #geomob supporter
[Muki Hakley](https://twitter.com/mhaklay) of
[UCL's ExCiteS research group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/excites)
has made it possible for us
to use the excellent facilities of UCL. We will be back in the
[G22 Lecture Theatre in the Pearson Building](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/pearson). 

Our format for the evening will be as it always was: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
[CARTO](https://carto.com), 
[Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/),
[Flock](https://flockcover.com), 
[KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/),
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/), 
and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).
Thank you sponsors! 

Our speakers on the evening of the 7th will be:


*  [Leigh Dodds](https://twitter.com/ldodds) of [the Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/) speaking about "how can we support the publication and use of more open geospatial data"

*  [Marc Tobias Metten](https://twitter.com/mtmthemovie) will be discussing the
   OpenStreetMap geocoder project [nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)

*  [Jason Sawle](https://twitter.com/GIS4Schools) will present [the Esri GIS for Schools Programme](https://schools.esriuk.com)

*  [Chris Hunt](https://twitter.com/thisisthechris) of [Controlled Frenzy](https://www.controlledfrenzy.co.uk/), will tell us about [The Common Line](https://thecommonline.uk/map/)

*  [David Heyman](https://twitter.com/davidheyman) will tell us about [PilotPlan](https://pilotplan.org) and using vector tiles as a geospatial server

I look forward to seeing you at UCL on the 7th of November,
