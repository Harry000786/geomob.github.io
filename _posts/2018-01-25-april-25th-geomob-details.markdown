Many thanks to everyone who joined us on the 23rd of January for our 
first #geomob of the year. I enjoyed the evening very much and hope you did 
as well. A special congratulations to [Nina Tumanishvili](https://twitter.com/ninachinoo) and [Steven Feldman](https://twitter.com/StevenFeldman), our
 first ever joint SplashMaps best speaker winners (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers))!

The next #geomob will be at 18:30 on the 25th of April. We will be back at UCL,
specifically in the Pearson Building.

So that we can have a sense of how many people will be attending **[please register on the event page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/geomob-25th-april-2018-tickets-42530900067)**, where you can also find a map to the exact location.

Our format will be the same as ever: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory. Then we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our generous sponsors:Â [CARTO](https://carto.com), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), [KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).

Our speakers on the evening of the 25th will be:

* [Ricardo Varela](https://twitter.com/phobeo) of [Localistico](http://localistico.com) 

* [Tim Marston](https://twitter.com/timmarston) of [CARTO](https://carto.com)

* [Eriol Fox](https://twitter.com/EriolDoesDesign) of [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com)

* [Jillian Kowalchuk](https://twitter.com/kowalchuk_jill) of [Safe and the City](https://www.safeandthecity.com)

* [Adam Hoyle](https://twitter.com/adamhoyle) of [OSM UK](https://osmuk.org)

I look forward to seeing you all on the evening of the 25th at UCL.
