Fellow geomobbsters,

<span>many thanks for the strong turn out [at our February event](http://geomobldn.org/post/43642061371/first-geomob-of-2013-7-feb-at-the-bcs). A good time was had by all. </span>

<span>The pace of geoinnovation remains relentless and as such we turn our attention to our next event. At 18:30 on Thursday the 25th of April we’ll be back at UCL, this time  in the Chadwick Lecture Theatre (in Basement of the Chadwick building - we’ll post signs). </span>

<span>As always many thanks to UCL for hosting us, and to our sponsors who make the whole thing possible. So that we can get a handle on numbers please [sign up on the Lanyrd page for the event](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob/), where you can also find a map.</span> 

<span>Our speaker line up is looking very good, <strike>nevertheless we may be able to squeeze in one more</strike>. (Edit: we’re now full for this event, but please let us know if you’d like to speak in the future) If anyone is interested (or have an interest in speaking at future geomobs) please get in touch - the easiest way is by pinging us on twitter. </span>
