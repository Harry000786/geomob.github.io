<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
The first London Geomob of 2020 will be at
<span class="b">18:30 on Wednesday the 18th of March, 2020 </span>
at [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/hub/) at (_[Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975)_).

<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been:

* doors open at 18:00, set up and general mingling (note there maybe a slight
delay getting into the meeting room as there is an event before us until 18:00)

* at 18:30 we begin the talks with a very brief introduction

* Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.
After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.

* We vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

* We head to a nearby pub for discussion and #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors.

* To be announced soon. Please volunteer if you would like to speak.
