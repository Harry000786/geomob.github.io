We typically run Geomob events every three months or so. But following a lot of interest from the speakers, we thought to squeeze one more in, before the year is out.

Here are the details, hope to see you there!

**WHEN**

24th of November

Doors at 18:30, talks start at 18:45

**WHERE**

[Room G08, Chadwick building, UCL, London, WC1E 6BT](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.52407&lon=-0.13373&zoom=17&layers=M "OSM")

**SPEAKERS**

- [Azmat](https://twitter.com/#!/azmingo) will introduce [Bus Mapper](http://www.busmapper.co.uk), a new app that every Londoner who takes the bus will find very useful and [CityMapper,](http://www.citymapper.co.uk) perfect to get around any city quickly and easily.

Please, sign up as “Attending” for this event on [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/geomob-november/) and follow [@geomob](http://twitter.com/#%21/geomob) on Twitter.

The bad new is that it won’t take place until November, the good new is that there is enough time to get ready for it!

See you all there!
