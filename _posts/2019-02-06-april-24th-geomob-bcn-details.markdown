Many thanks to everyone who came out and helped make
[our first #geomobBCN](/post/jan-30th-2019-geomob-barcelona-details)
a success. Steven Feldman wrote [a great summary of the evening](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/blog/geomob-bcn-is-born/).

Based on the enthusiastic response to our first event, I am pleased to say
we will work on making it a regular thing, aiming for 3-4 #geomobBCNs per year.
Of course that would not be possible without the generousity of our venue
partner [CoWorkIdea](https://coworkidea.com/en/) and we will be back at their
excellent co-working space on the evening of Wednesday, the 24th of April,
at [Carrer de Torres i Amat, 21, First Floor](https://goo.gl/maps/wEAX4uRU8EN2),

Just like our first event, and like #geomob in London (_BTW, our next event [there is on 19th of March](/post/mar-19th-2019-geomob-details)_) the goal of this
#geomobBCN will be to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).

Our second event would not be possible without speakers, and I was delighted
to have so many people volunteer. Please get in touch if you would like
to speak at a future #geomobBCN.

The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers (paid
for by the sponsors) at a nearby bar after the talks. 

We will follow the time-tested #geomob format:

* doors open at 18:00

* at 18:30 we begin with a very brief introduction

* a few speakers presenting their projects. Each speaker will have slides and
speak for 10-15 minutes. After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.
The talks will be in English.

* after the talks we will head to a nearby bar for #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors. 

Our speakers on the 24th of April will be

* [Tomaso Brezzi](https://twitter.com/TomasoBrezzi) of [Nested](https://nested.net/)

* [Joana Simoes](https://twitter.com/doublebyte) presenting a personal project about finding nearby people to transact with.

* [Jorge Ferrer Garc√≠a](https://twitter.com/jfsebastian) will describe some of the projects being worked on at [inAtlas](http://www.inatlas.com).

* [Adrienne Fanning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrienne-fanning-460b9340/) of [Sawcer](https://www.sawcer.com)

And hopefully one of two more.

All of that, and geobeers! A geo good time is guaranteed.

Please get in touch if you would also like to speak, either on the 30th or at
a future event.

Many thanks to our speakers, Coworkidea for hosting us, and of course to our
sponsors:
[AVUXI](https://www.avuxi.com),
[KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/) and 
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/). 

Please share the event details with everyone you know who may find the
evening interesting.

I look forward to seeing you all at 6:00 on the 24th of April
