Many thanks to everyone who came on Tuesday to 2015’s first #geomob.  I believe it was our best attended event yet, with a great mix of regulars and first timers. We had six excellent speakers, and if the twitterstream was indicative of the general mood, many found the talks to be thought provoking. Goal accomplished.

Here’s a photo from regular #geomobster [Giuseppe Sollazzo](https://twitter.com/puntofisso) of [Ian Hamilton](https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_) delivering the talk about designing a tube map for the colourblind that won him the [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com) best speaker prize. Well done Ian.

Congrats to all the speakers, but especially to [OpenAddresses UK](http://openaddressesuk.org) which launched on Wednesday, and [Robin Wilson](https://twitter.com/sciremotesense), who had to leave early to head back to Southampton to defend his PhD the following morning! 

Our next event will be on the 19th of March. We’ll have a blog post up here soon with the exact details, but you can already [sign up on the lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-march/),  we’ll be back in Shoreditch at Google’s Campus. And I’m pleased to say we already have five speakers set for our [May 19th #geomob](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-may/) as well, though the location is not yet confirmed.

This week’s event confirmed that London’s geo community remains in rude health and I look forward to a great year. Many thanks to our sponsors who make it all possible: [OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com), [KnowWhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk), [Pusher](https://pusher.com), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com).

More soon,
