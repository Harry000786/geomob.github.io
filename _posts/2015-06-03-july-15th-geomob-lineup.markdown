Many thanks to everyone who joined us on the 19th of May, and a special  congratulations to [Jerry Clough](https://twitter.com/SK53onOSM) who took home the SplashMaps best speaker prize. Here’s a picture of Jerry going his talk (photo credits to [Harry Wood](https://www.flickr.com/photos/harrywood/18071657196/in/photolist-twVY5u-qxbkSY-sCrhvV-tyYcYS-tzmLut-twVXhY-sCfMaS-thFKyU-rNVoqz-rNNBuw-rwkqt9-ruAGLF-rwt1BM-rLCryW-qxatBA-qPJA4i-pSXBd4-pyujYe-pwrVbS-pgZnY1-pyujHV-pyujDg-pydaBg-pwrUVS-pgYt5V-fb2w6r-fb2vZz-nCkh4B-njTixp-njT9AQ-nB5UyT-nkQQW6-nzk3E1-njTayu-nB5Utc-njTapm-h8HCVq-f7yjcg-fbgLGd-fb2vWv-fb2vSX-dTg55w-dTarVF-dTg54m-dTarQD-dTg52W-dTg4YG-dTarMz-dvELsb-dvELqC)):

The next #geomob will be on the 15th of July. We’re fortunate to once again  rely on the generosity of the BCS to host us at their excellent facilities near Covent Garden. Please [sign up on the lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-july/) so we can estimate the numbers.

We will start the evening at 18:30 and follow our time-honoured forumla: each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to present his or her project, then a few minutes for questions. After all five talks the audience will vote by show of hands to crown the winner, and we’ll all then head to a nearby pub to discuss.

Our speakers for the evening will be:

*   [Ivan Gayton](https://twitter.com/ivangayton), telling us about his “Ghetto Drone”  

*   January Geisert will tell us about the soon to launch [PARAMOS](https://twitter.com/ParamosApp)
*   [Shane Hudson](https://twitter.com/ShaneHudson) and [Edd Greer](https://twitter.com/edd_greer) will talk about “GeoRanking - a visualisation of area desirability”
*   [Tim Waters](https://twitter.com/tim_waters) will present [OpenHistoricalMap](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org)

and finally

*   [Liz Scott](https://twitter.com/birdmaps) will share her work [mapping bird migrations](http://birdmapsuk.blogspot.co.uk/)

I hope you free it’s another strong lineup. Of course all of it is only possible due to the generosity of our sponsors, and I’m very pleased to announce we have two new sponsors coming on board. But more about that in a future post.

Enjoy the summer and see you at 18:30 on the 15th of July at the BCS,
