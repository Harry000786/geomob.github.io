Friends, I have some good news. On the evening of Wednesday, January 30th we
will be hosting the first #geomob Barcelona (henceforth #geomobBCN)
at [CoWorkIdea](https://coworkidea.com/en/) at [Carrer de Torres i Amat, 21, First Floor](https://goo.gl/maps/wEAX4uRU8EN2),

As some of you may know I moved to Barcelona a few years ago.
In that time I have been exploring the local geo scene. While the tech
scene here is not yet quite the size of London, it has been growing
substantially over the past few years. We're fortunate to have many successful
and innovative companies working in fields like travel and classifieds where
location is of course a critical component. The time is right to form a
regular event to encourage the flow of ideas and collaboration in the scene. 

The goal of #geomobBCN will be the same as #geomob London: to provide
a forum to learn and exchange ideas about interesting services and projects
that deal with location. Everyone working in or curious about the location
space or with location services is welcome, you do not need to be some sort of
GIS expert (though GIS experts are of course welcome as well). What I am most
interested in is not pure geo technology, but rather the application of new
geo technologies in services and product of all kind.

Please tell everyone you know who may find the evening interesting.

The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers (paid
for by the sponsors) at a nearby bar after the talks. If our first event goes
well, we will hope to make #geomobBCN a regular (quarterly?) thing. 

We will follow the time-tested #geomob format:

* doors open at 18:00

* at 18:30 we begin with a very brief introduction

* a few speakers presenting their projects. Each speaker will have slides and
speak for 10-15 minutes. After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.
The talks will be in English.

* after the talks we will head to a nearby bar for #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors. 

Our speakers on the evening will be:

* [David Santos](https://twitter.com/dsantosmerino) of real estate service [Badi](https://badi.com)

* [Ed Freyfogle](https://twitter.com/freyfogle) of geocoding API [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/)

* [Carla Coll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ccollroca/) will present mapping startup [Gotaki Maps](https://twitter.com/Gotakimaps)

* [Alexis Batlle](https://twitter.com/AlexisBatlle), CEO and co-founder of location intelligence service [AVUXI](http://www.avuxi.com/)

All that, and geobeers! A geo good time is guaranteed.

Many thanks to our speakers, Coworkidea for hosting us, and of course to our
sponsors:
[AVUXI](https://www.avuxi.com),
[KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/) and 
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/). 

I look forward to seeing you all at 6:00 on the 30th of January for the first #geomobBCN,
