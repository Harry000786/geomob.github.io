This morning I had the chance to present our geocoder at [#WhereBerlin](http://wherecamp.de/). Here are my slides, as said in the talk we welcome all feedback and would love to learn your thoughts on our service, particularly how we can get better.

So far itâ€™s been a great event with many good talks, and a good chance to catch up with many friends, old and new, from the geo world. Many thanks to all the organizers, speakers and sponsors for making it possible.
