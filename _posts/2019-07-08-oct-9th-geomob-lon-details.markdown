The fourth London #geomob of 2019 will be at 18:30 (as always) on Tuesday the 8th of October, 2019 at at [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/hub/) at (_[Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975)_).

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
[Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/),
[Localistico](https://localistico.com/),
[Mappery](http://mappery.org),
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/), 
and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).
Thank you sponsors!

All of that, and geobeers! A geo good time is guaranteed.
