One last quick post before the weekend - some good news for PHPers. You can now access the API via the [Geocoder PHP library](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) if that sort of thing is your cup of tea. If not, you can still us our [stand alone PHP library](https://github.com/lokku/php-opencage-geocode). In both cases the code is open source and pull requests are much appreciated. 

If the idea of a little PHP for the weekend doesn’t excite you fear not, we of course also have [libraries for many other languages](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html). 

happy geocoding,

Ed
