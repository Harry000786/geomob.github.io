Fellow geo-enthusiasts, 

the next #geomob will be Wednesday the 14th of June at 18:30\. Thanks to the generosity of our long-time supporter [Muki Haklay](https://twitter.com/mhaklay), we’ll again be back in Pearson Lecture Theatre at UCL.

The evening will feature 10-15 minute talks from:

*   [Chetan Padia](https://twitter.com/chetbox), CTO of [Beeline](https://beeline.co/)  

*   [Oliver O’Brien](https://twitter.com/oobr) of UCL telling us about his “[all of the names](http://named.publicprofiler.org/)” project
*   [Sam Leach](https://twitter.com/SamuelLeach) of [Track24](https://www.track24.com/) 
*   [Dennis Bauszus](https://twitter.com/goldrydigital) tells us about OSM’s admin levels
*   [Iain Wells](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-wells-6b4b8045/), Head of Product at [Exaactly.com](https://exaactly.com/) 

after which we will vote for the best speaker ([see the past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)) and then retire to a nearby pub for geobeers and discussion. The beers are paid for by our generous sponsors [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), [KnowWhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/), and [what3words](https://what3words.com/).

Anyone with an interest in geo-innovation is invited to attend. [Please sign up on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-june/) so we can have an idea of the numbers. 

Following the June 14th event, our next event will be [19th of September back at the Traveltech Lab by London Bridge](http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-september/). Our final #geomob of 2017 will be [on the evening of October 25th, back at Geovation in Clerkenwell](https://geomob-october-2017.confetti.events/). We are currently seeking speakers for that event, please get in touch if you’d like to speak.

See you on June 14th,
