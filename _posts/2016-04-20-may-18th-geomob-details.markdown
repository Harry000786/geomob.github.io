Geofriends,

our next #geomob will be at 18:30 on Wednesday the 18th of May. We will once again be back at UCL in the Pearson Lecture Hall. Many thanks to UCL for once again having us back. There is a map on the Lanyrd page, and we will have signs up directing you to the room. Please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-may/) so we can predict how many people will be coming. At our March event not everyone fit in the room (apologies!) I am hopeful we will have a bigger room in May.

As always, we will kick off promptly. The evening will feature 10-15 minute talks from five speakers. After each speaker there will be time for a few questions from the audience. After the final speaker we’ll vote by show of hands for the winner of the SplashMaps best speaker prize, and then head off to the pub for geobeers generously funded by our sponsors. Many thanks to [KnowWhere](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [iGeolise](http://www.igeolise.com/), [Esri UK](http://www.esriuk.com/), [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/), and [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/) for making it happen.

Our lineup on the 18th is:

*   [Andrew Trigg](https://twitter.com/adtrigg), Head of Data at the [Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry)
*   [Yodit Stanton](https://twitter.com/yoditstanton), founder of [OpenSensors.io](https://www.opensensors.io)
*   Gareth Morgan, CEO of [Terrabotics](http://terrabotics.co/)
*   [Peter Thum-Bonanno](https://twitter.com/peter_t_b), co-founder of [GetAgent](https://www.getagent.co.uk/)
*   [Denise McKenzie](https://twitter.com/SpatialRed), head of outreach of the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/)

I look forward to a great evening of geo-fun. Many thanks to [Muki Haklay](https://twitter.com/mhaklay) of UCL, our speakers, and our sponsors for making it possible.

If you can’t make it in May please join us on [July 14th, September 7th, or November 2nd](http://geomobldn.org/post/137147492800/the-year-ahead).

See you at 18:30 on the 18th of May,
