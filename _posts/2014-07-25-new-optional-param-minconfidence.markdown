At the request of a user we just went live with a new optional parameter `min_confidence` which, as you would hopefully expect, will restrict results to only those with a minimum confidence level. More details in [the API docs with the other optional parameters](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#forward-opt) along with our [definition of “confidence”](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#confidence). More fun stuff to come soon, as always [the high-level product roadmap is available online](https://github.com/lokku/opencagedata-roadmap). 

Enjoy your weekend,
