Thank you to everyone who attended [the April 25th #geomob](/post/april-25th-geomob-details). A special congratulations to [Ricardo Varela](https://twitter.com/phobeo), our SplashMaps best speaker winner (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers))!

The next #geomob will be at 18:30 on the 6th of June, 2018. Our good friends 
at UCL have once again made their facilities available to us, we will be 
**in [the Chadwick Building](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/chadwick-building), room B05**. Many thanks to them, without such generosity #geomob would not be possible.

Our format will be the same as ever: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory. Then we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our generous sponsors:Â [CARTO](https://carto.com), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), [KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).

Our speakers on the evening of the 6th will be:

* [Charley Glynn](https://twitter.com/charley_glynn), of the Ordnance Survey, discussing the [OS Open Data Format Trial](http://data-format-trial-osonline.opendata.arcgis.com/)

* [Meha Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meha-nelson-5a0b7a27/), co-founder of [Predina](https://predina.com)

* [Dan Artus](https://twitter.com/DanOfArtus) of the [Extreme Citizen Science group at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/excites)

* [Chris Hildrey](http://cargocollective.com/chrishildrey) of [ProxyAddress](http://www.proxyaddress.co.uk/)

* [Hana Sutch](https://twitter.com/SutchFun) of [Go Jauntly](https://www.gojauntly.com/) 

* [Thomas Fletcher](https://twitter.com/thomasfletcher) of [Horizon Explorer](http://horizon-explorer.com)

I look forward to seeing you all on the evening of the 6th at UCL. If you can't
make the event, please join us after the summer on the 6th of September, when 
we'll be back at Geovation as part of the [UK Mapping Festival 2018](http://events.verisk.com/events/uk-mapping-festival-2018/event-summary-67f99cfd6a43404383d2a00346b708e1.aspx). 

see you on the 6th of June,
