Fellow geomobsters,

I’m delighted to announce our new sponsor [OpenCage Data](http://www.opencagedata.com).

OpenCage helps organisations make use of OpenStreetMap data by providing a simple and affordable data extraction service. In their own words “<span>OpenStreetMap data </span><span>when you want it, in the format you want it”. If you want to avoid the yak-shaving involved in ongoing data extraction give OpenCage a try.</span>

This week we’ll be posting the lineup for our next event which will be on 11th of July at 18:30 at Google’s Old Street Campus. Please register on [the event page on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-july/) so we can get a sense of the numbers.  We look forward to seeing everyone there, the post-talk geobeers will be on OpenCage Data and our other sponsor [knowwhere consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/).
