Friends,

I am delighted to announce that [CARTO](https://carto.com/) has become a #geomob sponsor!

CARTO is the platform for turning location data into business outcomes.

Their tools make it simple for anyone - especially those without a deep GIS background - to understand geodata, be it for analysis or to tell a story. Their products are used by thousands of customers around the world, from multinationals to start-ups.

Here’s a screenshot:

This is an exciting development not just because CARTO is a great geo brand, building amazing tools, but also because they first presented at #geomob back in September of 2012\. Since then the business has grown significantly, with offices in the UK, Spain, Estonia, and the US (East and West Coast). It is a great #geomob success story. They are [hiring for numerous roles](https://carto.com/careers/). You can learn more about CARTO and their products [on their site](https://carto.com), or by [following @CARTO](https://twitter.com/CARTO) on twitter.

CARTO joins our other sponsors: [KnowWhere Consulting](https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk), [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com), [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com), and [What3Words](http://what3words.com) - many thanks to all for helping support geo-innovation in London.

Please get in touch [if your brand would like to sponsor](http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship)  #geomob.

I look forward to seeing you all at [our next event on the 25th](http://geomobldn.org/post/165790781600/october-25th-geomob-details), when several members of the CARTO team will be in attendance,
