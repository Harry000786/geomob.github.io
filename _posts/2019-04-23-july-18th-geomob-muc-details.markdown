Please note - since this event is in a private office you will need to register in advance, so we have a sense of how many people will attend. [Please do so here](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Geomob-Munich-geomobMUC/events/260835076/?eventId=260835076&from=ref). Danke!

**Who should attend:** Geomob is for everyone who is interested in geospatial technology - be it mobility, location intelligence, computer vision, indoor mapping, navigation, drone, GIS or any other location data driven industry.

**Speakers:**

We are currently defining the speaker list, but our theme for the evening will be _Maps, Machine learning and AI_

Afterwards the talks there will be a discussion and networking session and we are looking forward to get everyone connected with each other!
