FYI we just added the [API Changelog](https://www.apichangelog.com/) widget to [our API documentation page](http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html) in case you want to be notified every time the docs page changes.

We’ve held off on doing this until now since as a beta service it was clear there was going to be a fair amount of change. It’s been a while though since there’s been any significant change to the API, in recent months the main changes to the documentation has been to try to clarify things that we see come up frequently in questions, the core API is now fairly settled.

Sign up by clicking on the widget. We hope you find it useful and thanks to the team at API Changelog for providing the service.
