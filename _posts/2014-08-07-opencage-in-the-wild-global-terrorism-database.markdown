Today we kick off what I sincerely hope will be a new regular feature here on the blog - an example of someone using the OpenCage geocoder “in the wild” to do something creative, important, or just plain cool. Today’s project falls into all three categories. A few weeks back we were approached by [Brian Wingenroth](https://twitter.com/bwingenroth) of University of Maryland in the US about using our geocoder for a visualization of all terrorism attacks as part of the university’s [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) project. 

The outcome [is now live](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/globe/index.html) and it is very impressive visually and hopefully serves as a useful tool in the discussion around this important (and unfortunate) topic. I encourage you to have a look, and we are proud to have played a small part. It is a good example of the great things people can build quickly when open-data is combined with powerful tools.

The project was covered in a bit more detail [over on Google Maps Mania](http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2014/08/mapping-global-terrorism-database.html). Congrats to Brian and the entire project team.

If you do something interesting or cool using our geocoder please get in touch, we’d love to feature it here.
