I’m delighted to announce that we’ll be sponsoring [GeoCamp ES](http://geocamp.es/), which will be held on the 22nd of October in Barcelona. GeoCamp is an unconference, a fun low-pressure chance to learn about lots of different geo topics. If you’re near Barcelona please [come along and join in](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/geocamp-es-tickets-10077228261).

Many thanks to the organisers, we’re looking forward to a great event. Hopefully we can give a talk sharing the pleasure and pain of geocoding.   

In other event news, this coming weekend we’ll be at [State of the Map](http://2016.stateofthemap.org/) in Brussels, [on November 2nd we’ll again be sponsoring #geomob in London](http://geomobldn.org/post/150628164010/details-of-the-nov-2nd-geomob) and Nov 3-4th we’ll be at [Where Berlin](http://wherecamp.de/). Hope to see you at one of these events. 

un abrazo,
