If you miss geo talks why don’t you check out this [talk](http://twitter.com/mhaklay/status/40088588167286784)? It’s organised by [Muki Haklay](http://twitter.com/mhaklay) (Senior lecturer in GIS at UCL) and features the team behind the [NoiseTube](http://www.noisetube.net/), an application that turns mobile phones into environmental data monitors.

We would also like to thank Muki Haklay and Ollie O'brien and everyone else in UCL for hosting us at our next Geomob event on **Thursday, 12th of May**.

Everyone who is interested in attending should [tag themselves as ‘attending’ on the event page](http://lanyrd.com/2011/gemob-may/), and we will announce the event at a later date.
