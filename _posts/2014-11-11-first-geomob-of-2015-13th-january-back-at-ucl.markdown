Hello geomobsters,

the first #geomob of 2015 will take place on the 13th of January at 18:30\. Our old friends at UCL have generously agreed to have us back, this time we’ll be in the [Gavin de Beer lecture theatre in the Anatomy building](http://lanyrd.com/venues/london/vdykh/). If you’ll be attending please sign up [on the lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob/) so we have a sense of the numbers to expect.

The evening looks to be our best one yet - I have said that before, but this lineup looks even better! We have a great mix of six diverse geo topics.

*   [Robin Wilson](https://twitter.com/sciremotesense) will discuss his work digitising the John Snow cholera map.
*   [Peter Wells](https://twitter.com/peterkwells) will tell us about the Open Addresses project
*   [Basil Safwat](https://twitter.com/basil) will present [Telescope Cards](http://www.telescopecards.com/)
*   [Max Gadney](https://twitter.com/maxgadney) will show off [After the Flood](http://www.aftertheflood.co/)’s London Squared map
*   [Ian Hamilton](https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_) will present an accessible tube map
*   [Doug Specht](https://twitter.com/DougSpecht) will talk about "Using GIS to legitimize User Generated Content (UGC) in human rights advocacy"

<span>As always each speaker will have maximum 15 minutes (we may go slightly longer for the game), and then a few minutes of audience questions. </span><span>After all that we’ll vote for the best speaker and head to a nearby pub for </span>discussion<span>. </span>

Many thanks to all who attended last week’s [November #geomob](http://geomobldn.org/post/98001859550/lineup-and-details-for-the-nov-4th-geomob), and a special congrats to [Robin Hawkes](https://twitter.com/robhawkes), who won the SplashMaps best speaker prize for his talk on the Vizicities building height tagger. 

Until then I wish all of you a great holiday season and a strong start to 2015\. Hopefully Santa will leave an atlas, a SplashMap, a new GPS device, or similar under your tree. No doubt there will be a London OpenStreetMap Christmas gathering, [details will appear here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/London), and I hope to see you all there.  

For those who can’t make it in January, we look forward to seeing you at the March 19th #geomob ([sign up here](http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-march/)). I welcome all speaker volunteers/suggestions. 

Happy holidays and see you on the 13th of January at 18:30,
