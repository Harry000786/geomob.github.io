The third London #geomob of 2019 will be at 18:30 (as always) on Wednesday the 
19th of June, 2019. 

Our good friends at [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/hub/) 
will once again be hosting us at their excellent venue (_[Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975)_).

Our format for the evening will be as it always has been: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
[Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/),
[Localistico](https://localistico.com/),
[Mappery](http://mappery.org),
[OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/), 
and [SplashMaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).
Thank you sponsors! 

Our speakers on the evening of the 19th will be:

* [James Smith](https://twitter.com/TheRealJimShady) from King's College will tell us about _Air quality on the London underground_.

* [Steve Karmeinsky](https://twitter.com/stevekennedyuk) will present his "_Digital Placemakers_" project.

* [Steve Chilton](https://twitter.com/steev8) tells us about "_OpenStreetMap, London and I_".

* [Gopi Garge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopikrishna-garge-3539/) from [GeoSpoc](https://geospoc.com) will give a talk entitled "_Stories from the field - Business, Utility, and Humanitarian Help_".

* [Graham Vowles](https://twitter.com/gvowles) of [Bloxstore](https://www.bloxstore.net/) will speak about "_Geography meets Creativity: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?_"

More speakers will be added here as people volunteer. Please let us know if you would like to speak.

Interesting talks, and geobeers! A geo good time is guaranteed.

If you can't attend (or even if you can) be sure to sign up for
[the #geomob mailing list](/mailing-list), where we will post talk summaries after the event.


I look forward to seeing you all at Geovation on the 19th of June,
