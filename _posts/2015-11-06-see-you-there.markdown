Over the next few weeks we’ll be attending (and speaking at) a few different events. If you’re there please say hello

Tomorrow (Sat 7th Nov) [Ed](https://twitter.com/freyfogle) will be speaking at the [Barcelona Perl Workshop](http://workshop.barcelona.pm/barcelona2015/). For those that don’t know most of our service is written in Perl.   

On the 11th, Ed will attend and give a lightening talk about our geocoder at the “XIV Fòrum TIG/SIG 2015″ a meetup of geo industry professionals in Barcelona, which unfortunately doesn’t seem to have a website.

On the 14th of November [Marc Tobias](https://twitter.com/mtmthemovie) will be at [Geolocation Camp](http://geolocationcamp.de/) in Dortmund, Germany. 

On the 26th and 27th of November Marc Tobias will head to Berlin for [WhereCamp Berlin](http://wherecamp.de/agenda).

And finally of course in January, on the 21st the next addition of [#geomob](http://geomobldn.org/), the London geo-innovation event we organise, will be taking place.   

Many thanks to all the organisers of these various events. We’ll see you there.
