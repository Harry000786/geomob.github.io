Our summer event will take place on the evening of July 14th, I’m delighted to announce we’ll be back in Clerkenwell at the Ordnance Survey’s [Geovation Hub](https://geovation.uk/hub/). It is a great facility and we’re fortunate that they’re once again hosting us. The evening will follow the time-honoured routine: we will have five speakers, each will present to the group for 10-15 minutes then field a few questions from the audience. Afterwards we’ll vote for the best speaker and then head to the pub where the drinks are generously made possible by our sponsors: [OpenCage Data](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), [Knowwhere Consulting](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/), [What3Words](http://what3words.com/), [iGeolise](http://www.igeolise.com/), and [Splashmaps](http://www.splash-maps.com/).

The talks start at 18:30 and you should please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-july/) so we have an idea of the numbers to expect.

Our speakers for the evening are:

*   [Gary Gale](https://twitter.com/vicchi), updating us on what What3Words is up to  

*   [Max Stephan](https://twitter.com/GeospatialMax) of Geovation Hub, telling us about all the support they offer geo start-ups
*   [Sarah Pritchard](https://twitter.com/Spritchard0), founder of [Treasure Pocket](http://www.treasurepocket.co.uk/)
*   [Giuseppe Sollazzo](https://twitter.com/puntofisso) will muse about Open Data  

*   [Christopher Wesson](https://twitter.com/ChrisWesson_UK) will tells about mapping Mars

All the makings of another great geo evening. If you unfortunately can’t make it in July our next event will be [on the 7th of September](http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-september/). 

Final note: we’re always on the look out for more sponsors. [Please get in touch if your brand wants to support geo-innovation](http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship). 

Have a great summer everyone, see you at 18:30 on July 14th
