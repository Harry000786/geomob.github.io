<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
The next #geomobBCN will be at
<span class="b">18:00 on Wednesday, the 2nd of October</span>.
I am delighted that we can once again rely on the hospitality of our friends at
[CoWorkIdea](https://coworkidea.com/en/), who will host us at their
excellent co-working space at [Carrer de Torres i Amat, 21, First Floor](https://goo.gl/maps/wEAX4uRU8EN2).


<div class="heading">Why?</div>

The goal of Geomob is to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).

The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers -
generously paid for by our sponsors at a nearby bar after the talks. 

<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

* doors open at 18:00, set up and general mingling

* at 18:30 we begin the talks with a very brief introduction

* Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.
After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.
The talks will be in English.

* We head to a nearby bar for discussion and #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors. 


<div class="heading">The speakers:</div>

* [Ana PÃ©rez Bao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-p%C3%A9rez-bao-ab088759/) presenting [GreenDEX](https://greendex.es) - using satellite image analysis to calculate vegetation coverage.

All of that, and geobeers and good discussion - a good time is guaranteed.

<div class="heading">Thanks</div>

Geomob would not be possible without speakers, and I was delighted
to have so many people volunteer. Please get in touch if you would like
