Geomobsters,

With maptember winding down, some of you might be ready for a geobreak. But the pace of geoinnovation remains relentless: there is no rest for the weary.

I’m pleased to announce our lineup for the Tuesday, October 29th #geomob. As always we will kick off at 18:30, we’re very thankful to our good friends at UCL for once again making a lecture room available. This time well be in Malet Place Engineering room 1.02, for a detailed map, please [see the Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-oct/) (where you should also please sign up so we can get a sense of the number of geoenthusiasts to expect). Please arrive on time so we can kick things off promptly. 

We’re fortunate to have six great speakers lined up for the event:

*   [Dimi Sztanko](https://twitter.com/sztanko) will talk about [walks.io](http://walks.io/), his circular walks generator.
*   [Sarah Goodwin](http://www.sgeoviz.me.uk) of City University London will show of some of her research around geo visualisation.
*   [Max Roberts](http://www.tubemapcentral.com/) of University of Essex will show off some of his alternative tube maps.
*   [Geoff Marshall](https://twitter.com/geofftech) of [Station Master app](http://www.stationmasterapp.com/) will talk about their experiences selling a public transport app.
*   [Tom Chance](https://twitter.com/tom_chance) will talk about his work on [“How polluted is my road”](http://www.howpollutedismyroad.org.uk). 

     and, last, but certainly not least, 

*   we welcome back [David Overton](https://twitter.com/dbyhundred) of [SplashMaps](http://www.splashmaps.net/) will tell us about their progress over the last year. 

As #geomob tradition dictates, each speaker will have 10-15 minutes and then five minutes for questions. Afterwards the mob will adjourn to a nearby pub for geobeers generously funded by our sponsors. 

One final note - we’re currently on the hunt for speakers for the [January 14th #geomob](http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob/), (the first has already committed) please let us know if you have any recommendations. 

We look forward to seeing you all on the 29th! Spread the word.
