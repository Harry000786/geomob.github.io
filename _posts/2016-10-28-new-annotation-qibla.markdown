Following last week’s [announcement of the new `currency` annotation](http://blog.opencagedata.com/post/152063767603/new-annotation-currency), today we can announce the addition of a `qibla` annotation.

For those not familiar, [Qibla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla) is the direction to Mecca, used during Muslim prayer. We use the great cirle method and the annotation we return shows the degrees (in decimal format, two places past the decimal) clockwise from true north (ie due east would be “90.00”).

As always, please refer to the API docs [for a full list of all annotations](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#annotations). You can turn annotations off by using [the optional `no_annotations` parameter](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt).

As-salamu alaykum,
