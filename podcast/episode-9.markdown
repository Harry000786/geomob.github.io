Ed talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/lexonic">Alex Wrottesley</a>, Head
of <a href="https://geovation.uk">Geovation</a>. Geovation is a phenomenal resource for the UK geo community. Many thanks to Alex and his team for frequently hosting Geomob in London over the last few years at thier excellent facility in Clerkenwell. I recommend to anyone working in geo in the UK that they should join, it is a great community and place to work. Any start-ups in the locaiton or real estate space should strongly consider joining the Geovation accelerator program.
