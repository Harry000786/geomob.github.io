In this episode Ed chats with <a href="https://twitter.com/muthukumarceg">Muthukumar Kumar</a>: navigation engineer, maker of leading geo blog <a href="https://geoawesomeness.com/">Geoawesomeness</a>, and the person who got Geomob Munich (#geomobMUC) going. We discuss several things, but especially how Muthu got the Munich community going, and how that might be a model for anyone in another city that wants to get a local Geomob community going.
