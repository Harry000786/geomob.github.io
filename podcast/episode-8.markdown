Note: this interview was recorded before the Coronavirus crisis really
gained momentum. While the virus is obviously having a dramatic impact on the
travel industry, we don't discuss that here. Instead we chat about some of the general trends in the travel industry, including the emergence of Google as a
competitor to the large travel booking sites.
