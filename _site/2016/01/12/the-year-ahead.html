<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>hopefully you all had a great holiday break and are looking forward to a geotastic 2016. Things of course <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/133268214275/first-geomob-of-2016-21-jan-back-at-ucl">kick off next week on the 21st with the first #geomob of the year back at UCL</a>, but I thought it might be helpful in terms of helping people plan (and to volunteer to speak) if we announce all the #geomob dates for the year now.</p>

<p>The 2016 #geomob dates are:</p>

<p><a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/133268214275/first-geomob-of-2016-21-jan-back-at-ucl">Thursday, 21 January</a><br />
<a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/139352132255/see-you-on-the-15th-of-march">Tuesday, 15 March</a> <br />
<a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/143107825400/may-18th-geomob-details">Wednesday, 18 May</a><br />
<a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/144971223060/summer-geomob-july-14th-at-geovation-hub">Thursday, 14 July</a><br />
Wednesday, 7 September (<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-september/">sign up</a>)<br />
Wednesday, 2 November (<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-november/">sign up</a>)</p>

<p>All events start at 18:30.</p>

<p>About a month or two before each event I do a detailed post announcing the lineup and details. We already have a full lineup of speakers for the 15th of March (as you can see over on the lanyrd page), but the other dates are still available. If you’re doing anything interesting around the concept of location - no matter whether you are a start-up, a hobbyist, an academic, or a multi-national internet giant - we would love to hear from you. Speaking slots are 10-15 minutes. It is a great chance to make your work know, gather feedback, and <a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">join a start-studded list of the London geo-elite</a>.</p>

<p>All of this is of course only possible due to the generous support of our sponsors. <a href="http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship">Please let us know if you or your organization would like to m help support London as a centre of geoinnovation</a>. A final note of thanks goes out to our hosts. Without them providing us venues the event would not be possible. I’d like to especially thank UCL and <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">the BCS</a> for their long-term and ongoing support in this regard.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/133268214275/first-geomob-of-2016-21-jan-back-at-ucl">at UCL on the 21st</a>,<br />
