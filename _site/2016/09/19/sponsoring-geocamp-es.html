<p>I’m delighted to announce that we’ll be sponsoring <a href="http://geocamp.es/">GeoCamp ES</a>, which will be held on the 22nd of October in Barcelona. GeoCamp is an unconference, a fun low-pressure chance to learn about lots of different geo topics. If you’re near Barcelona please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/geocamp-es-tickets-10077228261">come along and join in</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the organisers, we’re looking forward to a great event. Hopefully we can give a talk sharing the pleasure and pain of geocoding. </p>

<p>In other event news, this coming weekend we’ll be at <a href="http://2016.stateofthemap.org/">State of the Map</a> in Brussels, <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/150628164010/details-of-the-nov-2nd-geomob">on November 2nd we’ll again be sponsoring #geomob in London</a> and Nov 3-4th we’ll be at <a href="http://wherecamp.de/">Where Berlin</a>.
