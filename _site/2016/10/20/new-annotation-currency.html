<p>Hi,</p>

<p>things have been a bit silent on the blog for a while. Apologies, we have a few interviews in the works. We’ve also been busy with some of the more tedious aspects of running a business - for example we are now registered for VAT (it was as fun as it sounds!).</p>

<p>Regardless, the quest to make geocoding ever easier for developers knows no pause, and as such I am very pleased to announce we’ve gone live with a new annotation. We now return information about the local currency. </p>

<p>Many thanks to our friend <a href="https://github.com/Flimm">David Lowe</a>, whose <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::MoneyCurrency">Data::MoneyCurrency module</a> (which in turn builds on the great work of <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money">the Ruby “money” library</a>) made this very easy. </p>

<p>Here’s a look at the data we return:</p>

<p>As always you can <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#annotations">check out all the other annotations over on the docs page</a>. You can turn annotations off by using <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt">the optional no_annotations parameter</a>.</p>

<p>enjoy,</p>
