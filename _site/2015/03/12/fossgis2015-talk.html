<p>Yesterday OpenCage team member <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/mtmail">Marc Tobias</a>, had the chance to speak at <a href="http://www.fossgis.de/konferenz/2015/">FOSSGIS2015</a>. He gave a talk about the (insane) difficulty of geocoding in a world where silly humans insist on using non-unique placenames, and a high-level overview of the various services, both closed and open, that are available to accomplish the task. His slides are here, hopefully there’ll be video soon. </p>
