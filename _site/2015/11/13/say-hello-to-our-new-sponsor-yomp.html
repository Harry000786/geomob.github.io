<p>Fellow geomobsters, </p>

<p>please join me in welcoming <a href="http://yomp.co/">Yomp</a> to our list of sponsors! Yomp’s mission is to get more people cycling, running and walking more often, and they do this by developing software that allows companies, local authorities and schools to understand, encourage and reward active travel. If that sounds like a worthy goal, they are hiring, specifically <a href="https://unicornhunt.io/jobs/full-stack-php-javascript-developer-at-yomp">they are currently seeking a full stack developer role</a> to be based in their central London office. I encourage all of you to have a look, not least as I know many members of the #geomob community are advocates of active and sustainable travel. Yomp will be presenting an overview oft he location based aspects of their business at our March event. If you’d like to learn more int he meantime I encourage you to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/yomphq">@YompHQ</a> on twitter. </p>

<p>The generosity of our sponsors and hosts is what makes #geomob possible. If you’ve ever come along to an event and found the speakers stimulating and the free, post-talk beers refreshing, then please join me in thanking Yomp and the others. If your brand would like to expose itself to the London geo scene, please <a href="http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship">consider becoming a sponsor.</a> </p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all at upcoming #geomobs <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob/">on 21 January</a> (detailed blog post to come in very near future) and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-march/">15th of March</a>. </p>

<p>yours in geo-innovation,</p>
