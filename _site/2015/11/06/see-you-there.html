<p>Over the next few weeks we’ll be attending (and speaking at) a few different events. If you’re there please say hello</p>

<p>On the 11th, Ed will attend and give a lightening talk about our geocoder at the “XIV Fòrum TIG/SIG 2015″ a meetup of geo industry professionals in Barcelona, which unfortunately doesn’t seem to have a website.</p>

<p>On the 14th of November <a href="https://twitter.com/mtmthemovie">Marc Tobias</a> will be at <a href="http://geolocationcamp.de/">Geolocation Camp</a> in Dortmund, Germany. </p>

<p>On the 26th and 27th of November Marc Tobias will head to Berlin for <a href="http://wherecamp.de/agenda">WhereCamp Berlin</a>.</p>

<p>And finally of course in January, on the 21st the next addition of <a href="http://geomobldn.org/">#geomob</a>, the London geo-innovation event we organise, will be taking place. </p>
