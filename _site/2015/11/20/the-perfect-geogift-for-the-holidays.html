<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>the holiday season is rapidly approaching, and with it the need to find the perfect geo-themed gift for all the map lovers in your life (and those who perhaps don’t yet realise they are map lovers).</p>

<p>I wanted to remind you that our generous sponsor <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a> offers 10% off to all geomobsters. If you can not recall the voucher code <a href="https://twitter.com/geomob">please ping @geomob on twitter</a>.</p>

<p>For over a year now SplashMaps has not just generally helped make #geomob possible, but has also sponsored the best speaker award (see the winners in <a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">the #geomob hall of fame</a>). If you have enjoyed our events, found the speakers thought-provoking, and had engaging discussions at the post-event drinks, I encourage you to consider taking up the SplashMaps #geomob 10% off offer as you do your holiday shopping. Speaking from personal experience, <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/shop/make-map/">a splashmap makes a great personalised gift for anyone who enjoys the outdoors</a> - you can centre the map directly on their house and add a custom title, but they also offer maps of all popular outdoor sites in the UK. If you do decide to order a personalised map you will need to have your order in by the first week of December to ensure Christmas delivery, so don’t delay, but if you can’t quite decide on which map to get they offer gift vouchers.</p>

<p>The product itself is fantastic - a great tool for outdoor navigation but also a fantastic souvenir after a big hike or ride - and one of which we can all be proud of since SplashMaps kicked off their crowd-funding campaign with a talk at #geomob three years ago. Since then the business has grown significantly and now partners with traditional UK cartographic brands like the Ordnance Survey, <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/shop/a-to-z-london-splashmap/">A to Z</a> and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/?s=harvey&amp;post_type=product">Harvey</a>. And they’ve gone global; you can produce a custom map of anywhere in the world! They even teamed-up with past #geomob speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismikehall">Mike Hall</a>, to produce <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/shop/london-illustrated-splashmap/">his beautiful London illustrated map on fabric</a>. </p>

<p>In short, SplashMaps have something for any geo-enthusiast. I close with the SplashMaps video, for those perhaps not yet familiar with the product.</p>
