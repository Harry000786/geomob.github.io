<p>I’m pleased to announce I’ll be speaking about the OpenCage geocoder at the 39th Geoinquiets on the 2nd of July. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/39a-geoinquiets-2-de-juliol-de-2015-the-opencage-geocoder-an-api-based-geocoding-service-built-on-tickets-17083050865">Tickets and details of the event are available here</a>, if you’re in Barcelona please come along, I am sure it will be an interesting evening. As my Catalan is not yet quite fluent, I’ll be speaking in English, and will post the slides here on the blog afterwards. </p>

<p>In other event news Marc Tobias will be attending <a href="http://stateofthemap.us/">State of the Map US</a> in New York City next week. If you’re there please say hello. <a href="http://stateofthemap.us/program/">The lineup</a> looks fantastic, and the organizers seems to be going to great efforts to ensure it will be a great conference.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-july/">next #geomob will be the evening of July 15th</a> in London. Hope to see you there. </p>

<p>ciao,</p>
