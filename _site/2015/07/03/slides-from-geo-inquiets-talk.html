<p>Last night it was my pleasure to talk about our geocoder and a few other georelated thoughts at <a href="http://geoinquiets.cat/">Geo Inquiets</a>, the meetup of Catalan geo enthusiasts. Many thanks to them for having me and for the enjoyable geobeers afterwards.</p>

<p>Here are the slides of my talk.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn’t have the chance to show the <a href="https://vimeo.com/123205044">What3Words</a> video or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsiBdJ-XsoE">SplashMaps</a> video, but they are now linked here. </p>

<p>It seems the Catalonian government had, only the day before, announced a move to make much of their data available openly, and there was much discussion of how or if this might be incorporated in OpenStreetMap. Unfortunately I can’t seem to find a link in English of the announcement, but it’s great news nonetheless. </p>

<p>Overall a very enjoyable evening and I look forward to the next event. Thanks once again to the organisers. I encourage anyone interested in the Catalan geo scene to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/geoinquiets">@geoinquiets</a> on twitter. </p>

<p>For those looking for similar geoevents, I remind you that the next #geomob, the geo innovation event we organise and sponsor, will <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/122756697890/thanks-esri-uk-for-becoming-a-geomob-sponsor">be taking place in London on the 15th</a>. We hope to see you there.</p>
