<p>Great news, two new libraries to access the geocoding API have been made by members of the community!</p>

<p>Many thanks go out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hahnjuergen">Jürgen Hahn</a> for <a href="https://github.com/juergenhah/Haskell-Geocoder-OpenCage">his Haskell library</a> and <a href="http://blog.gurkensalat.com">Hakan Tandogan</a> for <a href="https://github.com/hakan42/java-opencage-geocoder">a java library</a>. We really appreciate it and will be sending both appropriate gifts (custom <a href="http://splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>) in the near future (once SplashMaps launches outside of the UK, which should happen very soon). </p>

<p>Both libraries are open source, and I am sure pull requests would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>All the various libraries, those made by us and those made by others, are documented <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html">over on the libraries page</a>. We’d of course love to see more for the languages we don’t yet cover.</p>

<p>thanks again guys, and happy geocoding everyone</p>
