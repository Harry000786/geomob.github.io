<p>Here at OpenCage we’re a very distributed team. Being distributed has many advantages, but it’s not perfect. So from time to time we supplement it with face to face meetings. This week we’re in Berlin making sense of all the feedback we’ve had the last few weeks and finalizing what to push on in the coming weeks. </p>
