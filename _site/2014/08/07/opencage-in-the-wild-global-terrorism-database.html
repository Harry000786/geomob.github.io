<p>Today we kick off what I sincerely hope will be a new regular feature here on the blog - an example of someone using the OpenCage geocoder “in the wild” to do something creative, important, or just plain cool. Today’s project falls into all three categories. A few weeks back we were approached by <a href="https://twitter.com/bwingenroth">Brian Wingenroth</a> of University of Maryland in the US about using our geocoder for a visualization of all terrorism attacks as part of the university’s <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database</a> project. </p>

<p>The outcome <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/globe/index.html">is now live</a> and it is very impressive visually and hopefully serves as a useful tool in the discussion around this important (and unfortunate) topic. I encourage you to have a look, and we are proud to have played a small part. It is a good example of the great things people can build quickly when open-data is combined with powerful tools.</p>

<p>The project was covered in a bit more detail <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2014/08/mapping-global-terrorism-database.html">over on Google Maps Mania</a>. Congrats to Brian and the entire project team.</p>

<p>If you do something interesting or cool using our geocoder please get in touch, we’d love to feature it here.</p>
