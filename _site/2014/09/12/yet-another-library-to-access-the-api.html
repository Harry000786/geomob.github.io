<p>One last quick post before the weekend - some good news for PHPers. You can now access the API via the <a href="https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder">Geocoder PHP library</a> if that sort of thing is your cup of tea. If not, you can still us our <a href="https://github.com/lokku/php-opencage-geocode">stand alone PHP library</a>. In both cases the code is open source and pull requests are much appreciated. </p>

<p>If the idea of a little PHP for the weekend doesn’t excite you fear not, we of course also have <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html">libraries for many other languages</a>. </p>

<p>happy geocoding,</p>
