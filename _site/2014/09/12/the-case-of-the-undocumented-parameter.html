<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>thanks to some great feedback from a user, we were poking around in the code yesterday and come to an embarrassing realization. Since we first went public we’ve supported the optional parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">limit</code> to limit the number of results we return. Unfortunately it seems that never made it to the documentation. Apologies, <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#forward-opt">it’s there now</a>. By default we return 10 results.</p>

<p>Sorry about that and please keep the feedback coming. It really helps.</p>

<p>Have a good weekend,</p>
