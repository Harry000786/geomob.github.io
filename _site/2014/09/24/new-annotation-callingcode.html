<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I just called to say we just went live with yet another new annotation, results now have the international phone calling code of their country. If you’re into geo trivia (and frankly if you’re reading the blog of a geocoding service, you better be) check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes">full list over on Wikipedia</a>. </p>

<p>What’s that you say, you already knew that the calling code of Slovenia was +386. Well good for you. You can <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#annotations">check out the other annotations over on the docs page</a>. </p>

<p>yours in geocoding,</p>
