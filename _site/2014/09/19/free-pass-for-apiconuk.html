<p>Hi, </p>

<p>next Thursday (25th of Sept) I’ll be speaking at <a href="http://www.apiconuk.com/">#APIconUK</a> here in London. It’s a three day conference targeting anyone using or developing APIs organised by the good folks behind <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>

<p>I have one free pass for all three days to give away, first person to comment here can have it. </p>

<p>If you can’t make it to London fear not. the talks will be recorded I’ll post my slides here once I have them ready.</p>
