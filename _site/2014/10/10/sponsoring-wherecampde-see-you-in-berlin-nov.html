<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>great news, <a href="http://wherecamp.de/">WhereCamp</a> is taking place in Berlin from the 13th -15th of November and the OpenCage team will be there. Hopefully we’ll have the chance to give a talk about what we’ve been up to. If past WhereCamps are any indicator it will be a great event, if you’re doing something interesting in geo please consider giving a talk - you have until the 15th of October to apply.</p>

<p>I’m also proud to say our parent company, <a href="http://lokku.com/">Lokku</a>, is again <a href="http://wherecamp.de/post/99558630253/lokku-long-time-supporters-of-geo-innovation">sponsoring the event</a>, continuing our <a href="http://blog.lokku.com/post/86345846298/giving-back">long tradition of sponsoring geo-innovation</a>. Even better news is that <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>, which Lokku seed invested in last year, will be awarding prizes to the three best speakers, as chosen by the audience, to celebrate their much anticipated international launch.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the organisers for putting together what will surely be a great event, I look forward to seeing everyone. As part of our interview series <a href="http://blog.opencagedata.com/post/95809903843/open-geo-interview-series-jan-nowak">we spoke with Jan Nowak</a>, one of the organisers, back in August. Give it a read to get some more background on WhereCamp.</p>

<p>bis bald in Berlin,</p>
