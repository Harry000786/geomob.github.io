<p>We’re winding down for the year to take a few days off to reflect. Many thanks to everyone for their support in 2014. We’ve been blown away by the positive response to the geocoder, and look forward to moving out of beta in 2015. Please keep the feedback (and the pull requests!) coming. </p>

<p>As a gesture of our appreciation, our parent company, <a href="http://lokku.com">Lokku</a>, has <a href="http://blog.lokku.com/post/106050009453/thanks-for-a-great-year">continued it’s tradition of donating to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a>. </p>

<p>Happy mapping and see you in 2015!</p>
