<p>Great news for all of you using the <a href="http://golang.org/">go programming language</a> - this morning we discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/johannesboyne">Johannes Boyne</a> has been kind enough to <a href="https://github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo/pull/22">add support for the OpenCage geocoder to the golang-geo library</a>. So if you’re a hardcore go zealot who’s been holding off on using our API you now have no more excuses. </p>

<p>Herzlichen Dank Johannes! Next week our friends at <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a> will be launching outside of Great Britain, and we’ll be sending a code good for a free SplashMap to everyone who has contributed a library. </p>

<p>As a reminder <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/code.html">all the various language libraries for accessing the geocoder are available here</a>, some we support, some are made by volunteers like Johannes. We have many of the major languages, but would love to see more. Please let us know if you develop something.</p>

<p>happy geocoding,</p>
