<p>This morning I had the chance to present our geocoder at <a href="http://wherecamp.de/">#WhereBerlin</a>. Here are my slides, as said in the talk we welcome all feedback and would love to learn your thoughts on our service, particularly how we can get better.</p>

<p>So far itâ€™s been a great event with many good talks, and a good chance to catch up with many friends, old and new, from the geo world. Many thanks to all the organizers, speakers and sponsors for making it possible.</p>
