<p>Hello geocoders,</p>

<p>we’ve just rolled out another <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#annotations">new annotation - timezones</a>. This is a feature <a href="https://trac.openstreetmap.org/ticket/4200">we’ve seen asked for several times on the nominatim request list</a>. For various reasons the nominatim team has decided it’s not a core part of the service and they’d rather not implement, which is fair enough. But we know at least some developers want it, so here it is.</p>

<p>We now return the following:</p>

<pre>"timezone" : {
  "name" : "Europe/Berlin",
  "now_in_dst" : 1,
  "offset_sec" : 7200,
  "offset_string" : 200,
  "short_name" : "CEST"
}
</pre>

<p>Hopefully this is just one of many small examples of useful tweaks we can add to make developers’ lives easier.</p>

<p>Timezones and time in general is of course a fairly rich technical topic, if you want to learn more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">Wikipedia is a great place to dive in</a>. </p>

<p>We welcome any and all feedback, and especially suggestions for more annotations you’d like to see. As always you can turn annotations off via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">no_annotations</code> parameter.</p>
