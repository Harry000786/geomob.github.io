**Who should attend?**

Geomob is a community of academics, developers, industry professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about location data driven products and businesses in Munich and beyond. 

We seek to create a group of diverse participants and speakers. The goal for all of us is to better understand how location data and the technology around it affects all aspects of development. 

Geomob is for everyone interested in geospatial technology - be it mobility, location intelligence, computer vision, indoor mapping, navigation, drone, GIS or any other location data driven industry. 

We aim to meet every two or three months, providing a relaxed forum to discuss geoinnovation, whether its for fun or profit. 

Please come along to learn more about location technology and discover what we can do to shape the future of the industry together.
