<h3>Become a #geomob sponsor</h3>
      

#geomob is made possible by our generous hosts and sponsors. If your brand
would like to help foster geoinnovation in London
<a href="mailto:geomob@opencagedata.com">please get in touch</a>.

<p/>
<div>
  Sponsoring #geomob is a very low-effort, highly affordable way to reach the
  London location based service developer community. Sponsorship costs either
  &pound;150 for a single event or &pound;600 for an annual package (6 events).
</div>


<p/>Sponsors receive:
<ul>
  <li>logo on our website</li>
  <li>branding at the event in the form of a logo in the intro presentation</li>
  <li>a mention on <a href="https://twitter.com/geomob">our twitter account</a>
    before each event</li>
  <li>a dedicated post on the site at the start of the sponsorship (annual
    package only)</li>
  <li>2 minutes to address the audience at the start of each event. Typically
    we have 50-75 attendees.</li>
  <li>good geokarma</li>
  <li>we welcome all ideas for deeper partnership that fit the #geomob ethos.
    A great example is the audience voted SplashMaps prize for best speaker.
  </li>
</ul>

The sponsorship funds are used exclusively to pay for the post-event pub
visits where attendees discuss the ideas and start-ups presented. If this is
of interest to your brand please email geomob @ opencagedata.com. We look
forward to hearing from you. Many thanks to all past and present sponsors.
